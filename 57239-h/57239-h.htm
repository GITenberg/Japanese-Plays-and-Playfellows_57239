<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="noindent"><em>I do not pretend to compete in the crowded field of
Japanese sociology with those who have lived more
than six months or less than six weeks in the country.
My own stay was limited to half a year. I had, of
course, studied the language with native teachers and
devoured the records of foreign travellers. I concluded
that theatrical matters had been less fully described
than any other: to them, accordingly, I devoted most
attention. But there were other themes on which I
had been insufficiently informed. Impersonal essays
are, therefore, supplemented by personal reminiscences,
for which I claim indulgence. If the first now seem to
me too short, the second may seem to others too long.
Yet I have tried only to select incidents and characteristics
which differ strikingly from Western ways.</em></p>

<p><em>Austere critics will assuredly resent the excess of
incense burned in these pages in honour of the</em> musumé.
<em>But, whether she and they like it or not, she continues
to summarise in her dainty little person much of her
country’s magic: its picturesqueness, its kindness, its
politeness. On certain symptoms of anti-foreign feeling
I have dwelt at some length, because the obvious witchery
of Japan so often results in the suppression of unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
testimony by those whose own souvenirs are pleasantness
itself. There is certainly no reason why the Japanese
should exhibit more altruism to other nations than is exhibited
in the reverse case. The apprehensions expressed
by such an admirer of the race as Mr. A. B. Mitford,
in a recent letter to the</em> <cite><span class="fsnormal">Times</span></cite> <em>as to the expediency of
giving them too free a hand in the solution of the Chinese
problem, however unwelcome to advocates of an Anglo-Japanese
alliance, deserve to be well weighed. Neither
pro-Japanese tourist nor anti-Japanese resident can refuse
admiration to the courage and cleverness of those
Happy Islanders, whose foreign policy is better left to
impartial pens for judgment. A partial spectator, I
can only render appreciative thanks for what I have
seen and loved.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">A foreign country for most travellers is very like a
theatre. They arrive in holiday mood, resolving to
be pleased, since otherwise their judgment in choosing
that country rather than another, their faculty of
appreciating what so many have proclaimed delectable,
might seem at fault. Should their choice have
fallen on Japan, be sure that eulogistic notices from
the pens of Sir Edwin Arnold and M. Pierre Loti
have prepared them to enjoy the daintiest of comediettas.
They reach the enchanted shore. They
pass swiftly from one aspect of fairyland to another.
Nothing happens to shake their preconceived conviction
that in the Land of the Rising Sun Nature began
and Art completed a yellow paradise. They do not
heed the jeremiads of resident aliens, nor the bitter
cry of outcast professors, who gather thorns where
the tourist is dazzled by cherry-blossom. The picturesque
unreality of common things abets illusion.
Surely these dolls’ houses of wood and paper, these
canopies of rosy bloom and curtains of purple wistaria,
the gigantic cryptomeria, the tentacular pines, the
azure inland sea and snow-streaked Fuji itself&mdash;surely
all these compose a superb <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en scène</i> for poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
comedy! And when “the crowd” enters, a smiling
crowd of straw-sandalled rickshaw-runners, of kneeling
tea-house girls, and shaven babies, arrayed like
bright-winged butterflies, churlish indeed were the
spectator who should refuse to smile back and cheer
with the best. Then consider the privileges which he
may enjoy in that admirably arranged theatre. Were
he in his own country, the footlights divide him for a
few hours at most from actors whose privacy, however
coveted, he may seldom hope to invade. But on
Japanese soil he may often obtain, by fee or favour,
like the stage-struck noble of Molière’s and Shakespeare’s
time, familiar acquaintance with performance
and performers. The latter are, on the stage, his
puppets; off the stage, his friends. Indeed, he confounds
the two, and ends by treating them with
affectionate condescension. This attitude, which he
half-involuntarily assumes from an ever-present consciousness
of superior civilisation (as he considers it),
deceives only himself. The polite but thoughtful
patriot, perceiving that his temples are regarded as
bric-à-brac, his race as a race of ingenious marionettes,
protests in vain against the unwelcome flattery of
surprised admirers. “To this kind of people,”
wrote Mr. Fukai, one of the ablest journalists in
Tōkyō, “our country is simply a play-ground for
globe-trotters, our people a band of cheerful, merry
playfellows. Painstaking inquiries are made about
Japanese curios and objects of art&mdash;sometimes important,
no doubt, but sometimes ridiculously trivial&mdash;while
the investigation of such subjects as the
ethical life, the social and political institutions, are
far too much neglected. The history of the nation is
ignored, and our recent progress is supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
wholly owing to a miraculous touch of Western
civilisation.” But who is to remedy this unfortunate
susceptibility on the part of foreigners? The foreign
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</i> has his work to do&mdash;diplomatic, professional,
or commercial; the native is in no particular hurry to
court the esteem of outsiders, being quite contented
with his own high estimate of himself. Must it always
be an officer “on short leave,” or a journalist in a
hurry, who undertakes to record superficial impressions
of a passing spectacle? At least, it is no use
reporting from the stalls what the casual playgoer
imagines he has seen, unless his report be confirmed
and controlled by those who move in the mysterious
world “behind the scenes,” where the drama of
popular existence is more adequately observed and
to a great extent directed. Happily, the judicious
inquirer has only to choose between competent guides,
whose eyes are no longer confused by the glimmer of
dancing lanterns. Let us pass behind the scenes, and
discover, if we can, what sort of piece is being rehearsed&mdash;what
mode of action the performers affect.
If we lose some illusions, we may gain a profitable
glimpse of decorously veiled truths.</p>

<p>The foreign resident is rarely cast for an important
part, never for a permanent one. It is notorious that
he lacks æsthetic charm. His wife and children, his
club and counting-house, his racecourse and cricket-field,
are standing tokens of unassimilative exile. In
England he would be a good citizen and an excellent
fellow, sure of his seat on the School Board or County
Council, if not in Parliament, supposing that his ambitions
included that of service to the community.
But in Kōbe or Yokohama he lives as isolated from
the fascinating “native-born” as any Jew in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
mediæval ghetto. And he does not feel the spell
which takes the bookmaker captive. It will not do to
dismiss him as a Philistine, a coarse barbarian, whose
only aim is to exploit the country for his own benefit,
since, on closer acquaintance, you find him, more
often than not, cultured, kindly, and just. What, then,
can be the cause of his extraordinary antipathy to the
land, ideally perfect as it appears to us, in which his
lines are cast? For every blessing you pronounce
he replies with a malediction, and, since his life behind
the scenes is at least nearer actuality than your own,
you borrow his eyes, with which the better to contemplate
a Japanese Janus, Whose smiling visage fills you
with delight, though at him is levelled a forbidding
frown.</p>

<p>The root of his discomfort and your enchantment is
a profoundly narrow patriotism. Viewed from without,
this brave and alert nation, courteous to strangers
and glad to excite admiration, retaining so much that
is picturesque and unique, yet capable of appropriating
the external panoply of Western civilisation, might
seem more companionable than any other; viewed
from within, it is evidently a close corporation, intolerant
of rivalry, diligent to protect itself, and determined
to restrict at all costs “Japan to the Japanese.”
It is futile to blame this trait, which springs inevitably
from the forced seclusion of two centuries, during
which period the barbarian was rigorously excluded
until he obtained readmission at the cannon’s mouth.
Nor is such hostile feeling confined to the ignorant.
On the contrary, the farther you go from the great
centres, where the mixture of races might be expected
to produce a better mutual understanding, the more
amiable is your reception. The mercantile classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
dread and dislike the invading trader, while imitating
his methods, so far as they can grasp them, with the
intention of ousting him as much as possible from
their markets. Even the intellectual classes, quick to
appreciate the value of Western science, arms, and
government, are none the nearer spiritually through
their acquisition. Mr. Lafcadio Hearn, whose passionate
devotion to his adopted country has inspired
many pæans of tender praise, yet writes: “Between
the most elevated class of thoroughly modernised
Japanese and the Western thinker anything akin to
intellectual sympathy is non-existent: it is replaced
on the native side by a cold and faultless politeness.”
Finally, a Tōkyō critic, whose language is as vigorous
as his disillusion is genuine, complains thus bitterly
in <cite>The Orient</cite> (April 1899) of “The Rest of the
World”:</p>

<p>“From first to last our foreign records have shown
almost insatiable greed on the part of our treaty-allies.
We have, it is true, asked for no favours; and it is
equally certain that we have not received any. There
never has been any real feeling of fraternal amity
between us and our allies; and this not because we
were not willing, indeed eager, to take the initiative,
but because our treaty-allies have held superciliously
aloof and grudged us an entrance into the comity of
nations. All things considered, we do not find the
debt of gratitude we owe to foreign lands beyond
power of bearing. Civilisation? We had that before
ever Commodore Perry came to Uraga and Mississippi
Bay. Schools? Well, text-books are to be bought
in the open market, and our students have always
paid their way at Western universities. Railways?
Yes, but look at the absurd price we had to pay for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the first line between Tōkyō and Yokohama! And
so on with the whole list. We have paid the highest
market price for our experience, with a thumping big
commission for the privilege of buying it even at that
rate. Yes, we have profited, but largely lost our own
self-respect in the profiting.”</p>

<p>Innocently unaware of storms in the beautiful
Satsuma tea-pot, the globe-trotter goes his way, playing
and paying to the satisfaction of all. But the
business man, whose presence is an affront and not a
compliment, has to bear the brunt of them. The difficulties
which beset his calling are not to be paralleled
elsewhere. There was a time when the native merchant
would try to intimidate his rival into concluding
a bargain by employing <em>sōshi</em>, importunate bravoes, to
lay siege at all hours to the private and official door of
their victim, until he capitulated or demanded police
protection. But this somewhat <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> procedure did
not command general approval. More easy and more
usual is the device of ordering goods and refusing to
take delivery except at a much reduced rate. The
perpetually quoted case of Cornes <em>v.</em> Kimura (Yokohama,
1894), which the reader will find described at
length in Mr. Chamberlain’s “Things Japanese”
(under the heading “Trade”), is more eloquent than
pages of second-hand rhetoric. Briefly, the British
importer, in spite of a verdict given in his favour by a
Japanese judge, was compelled to retain some of the
ordered goods, at a loss of 2500 <em>yen</em>, on pain of being
boycotted by the Yarn Traders’ Guild. If this case
stood alone, one would be loath to revive recollection
of it, but there remains so many a slip between the
signing of similar contracts and their fulfilments, that
the warehouses at the treaty-ports are never without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
incriminating bales, which lower Japanese credit and
testify to the slow growth of commercial honesty. To
eliminate the foreign importer altogether is, of course,
better than to boycott him, and this, with Government
aid, is gradually being accomplished. First, a law was
passed that Government contracts for plant and
material were to be given only to Japanese subjects.
Then, when it was found that a foreign firm would
try to evade this by employing a Japanese man of
straw, an enactment was issued for the re-inspection
of all plant on arrival in Japan. Mr. Stafford
Ransome, in an article contributed to <cite>The Engineer</cite>
on the subject of this official re-inspection, quotes the
case of 16,000 tons of cast-iron pipes supplied by one
Belgian and two British firms for the Tōkyō waterworks.
Of the 10,000 tons of Belgian pipes only
2700 were accepted, and of the English 4000 out of
6000 tons. Yet in his opinion the rejected pipes
were perfectly good for the purpose. That experience
will correct short-sighted dishonesty, that the
native merchant will gradually master the principles of
international trade and become as respected as he was
in feudal days despised, nobody doubts; and if for
the moment the stranger within his gates must suffer,
the gates are not yet stripped of all their gold.
Already the Chambers of Commerce have realised
that capital is cosmopolitan, and that excess of
chauvinism spells bankruptcy for local enterprise.
So long as the laws forbid the foreigner to own land,
to hold shares in native companies or to assist in
their management, he is naturally shy of responding
to invitations to invest. But at first such invitations
were not frequent. Ten years ago the craze for joint-stock
companies, though widespread, was yet hedged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in by patriotic precaution. The promoters had no
desire to share with outsiders the golden fruit which
seemed to beckon from speculative boughs. Moreover,
the Government, always paternal from sentiment
and tradition, would often pledge its support in liberal
subsidies. The defeat of China redoubled the victor’s
confidence in his capacity to develop his own possessions
with his own resources. But events have not
kept pace with his hopes. The greater portion of the
indemnity was diverted, after all, into British pockets
in return for unproductive ironclads: prices went up,
dividends went down; the shining fruit was turned
to ashes through inexpert gardening, for the art of
industrial horticulture is not to be learned in a day,
especially by amateurs, who sometimes drew an
erratic line between private and public consumption
of the crop. Whatever the causes, those very
Chambers of Commerce, which had strongly opposed
the introduction of foreign capital, passed in 1898&ndash;99
one resolution after another to the effect that aliens be
permitted and solicited to contribute where the funds
of indigenous subscribers required to be supplemented.
It does not, however, seem probable that foreign
investors will be in any hurry to unloose their purse-strings,
unless and until the over-cautious patriot can
be persuaded to modify the laws in such a way as will
give his coadjutor the right to share in the management
and responsibility of any scheme towards the
success of which his money may be largely, even preponderantly,
instrumental.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that apprehension and
mistrust are monopolised by one party to this subterranean
war. For five years it has been impossible
to open an English journal published in the treaty-ports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
without finding in it some dismal prophecy of
the time (it began on June 18, 1899) when the
treaties concluded by Lord Rosebery’s Government
should be put into operation, when the walls of the
ghetto should be razed, when the British lion and
the Japanese lamb must lie down together in unity.
The right to travel in the interior without passports,
and to reside in any district whatsoever without special
permission, are the only advantages conferred by the
treaties on resident aliens&mdash;advantages which he
would enjoy as a matter of course in any civilised
country. The disadvantages, of which he fears the
inconvenience, to use no stronger term, are numerous.
Extra-territoriality being abolished, he becomes subject
to Japanese law, which is incompletely codified
and must be administered by men whose patriotic
bias and sense of justice may be subjected at times to
a severe strain. Still, the right to exercise jurisdiction
on all within her borders cannot be refused, without
insult, to a civilised Power. The right to impose
duty on imports (hitherto limited to five per cent.) up
to thirty or forty per cent. is not only undeniable, but
absolutely desirable in the interests of Japanese trade.
It is suggested, however, that such high duties might
be levied on objects which are indispensable to
foreigners and of little utility to natives, as to form a
lever for the gradual ejection of aliens. There is no
guarantee that the freedom of the Press and the freedom
of public meeting will be exempt from those
restrictions, which are daily and legally imposed on
the Japanese themselves. The coasting trade, the right
of doctors and lawyers to practise without a Japanese
diploma, the conditions of holding and selling leases&mdash;on
these most vital points the utmost uncertainty exists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
No wonder that Mr. B. H. Chamberlain asked,
“Could any one imagine such terms having ever been
agreed to except as the result of a disastrous war?”</p>

<p>Happily, between the discontented British and the
ultra-patriotic Japanese lies a barrier of prudent statesmanship,
which has proved itself equal to solving
harder problems than any with which the Western
world is confronted. No other Eastern nation has
known how to transform its polity in accordance with
Occidental ideas without provoking internal disruption
or external conquest. It is not yet realised that the
credit of the achievement is due to a very small band
of men&mdash;to the Marquess Ito and his associates on
the one hand and the foreign instructors on the
other, whose names are too soon forgotten, while
their works live after them. Though all their compatriots
now reap in advancing prestige and prosperity
the benefits of the work performed by the
“Clan Statesmen,” it must not be forgotten that
much of that work was accomplished in the face of
every obstacle which prejudice and short-sightedness
could interpose. Popular dissatisfaction was adroitly
diverted by declaring war on China at the moment when
factious opposition was bringing discredit on the four-years-old
parliamentary Government, and Ministers
were strong enough to hold an indignant nation in
hand when the fruits of war were so unscrupulously
torn from their grasp by Muscovite intrigue. Indications
are not wanting that the spirit of tactful sense
which has steered Japan through so many tempests
is competent to allay those prognosticated by the
Cassandras of Kōbe and Yokohama. Those journalistic
beldames, who predicted sickness and death
for the European inmate of a Japanese prison unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he should be granted a special diet and a particular
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, have been already conciliated by the construction
of an expensive gaol, which it is hoped they
will never be called upon to occupy. This building,
situated at Sugamo, covers an area of about 28,000
square yards. It is provided with tables and chairs,
and the cells will be lighted with electricity. Thus
the grievance is redressed before it can even occur;
murder is averted; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab uno disce omnes</i>.</p>

<p>Before dismissing from consideration the prevalent
hostility to foreign residents, more noticeable in the
ports than elsewhere, and most pronounced in relation
to mercantile rivals, a word should be said as to its
effects on mission work. Between 1878 and 1888
Christianity appeared to be carrying all before it.
The land was honeycombed with evangelists of every
sect, from the resplendent deacons of the Orthodox
Russian cathedral, which so insolently dominates the
capital from the summit of Suruga-dai, to the dingy
crowd of Methodists, Baptists, Unitarians, Universalists,
and others, none of whom were without a
hopeful following of more or less sincere converts. In
fact, so fashionable did the once-persecuted faith
become that Mr. Fukuzawa, “the Jowett of Japan,”
the intellectual father of her most progressive pioneers,
advocated for a time that it should be adopted as
the national religion, by no means on account of its
intrinsic merits, but rather as a certificate of spiritual
respectability and a passport to more intimate relationship
with the Powers which call themselves Christian.
This success is easily explained. Not only were
many of the missionaries men of high principle and
attractive personality, but they had the wisdom to
minimise doctrinal differences and the opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
conferring no small material benefit on their disciples
by teaching them the English tongue. The commercial
value of an English education stood high, and
the army of native Christians had a better chance than
most of obtaining posts in governmental or other
offices. I may mention in passing that the first professed
Christian to hold ministerial rank was the
Minister of Education in the short-lived Okuma-Itagaki
Government of 1898.</p>

<p>Of course, I would not insinuate that cases of
genuine conversion were not numerous and productive
of moral regeneration, or that the creed of Christendom
has failed to strike root among the simple and
warm-hearted peasantry. But it is certain that among
the educated classes it is now viewed with rationalistic
indifference.</p>

<p>Mr. G. W. Aston, towards the close of his “History
of Japanese Literature,” makes a very significant
admission:</p>

<p>“The process of absorbing new ideas, which has
mainly occupied the Japanese nation during the last
thirty years, is incomplete in one very important particular.
Although much in European thought which
is inseparable from Christianity has been freely
adopted by Japan, the Christian religion itself has
made comparatively little progress. The writings of
the Kamakura and two subsequent periods are penetrated
with Buddhism, and those of the Yedo age
with moral and religious ideas derived from China.
Christianity has still to put its stamp on the literature
of the Tōkyō period.”</p>

<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="525" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shintō Temple at Miyajima.</div>
</div>

<p>Whether this apathy towards Christian teaching
should be attributed, as some aver, to an incapacity
for abstract speculation, or, as others assert, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>revolution which its adoption would entail in the
position of women, need not be discussed at present.
Let the following facts speak for themselves. The
latest available statistics show that the number of
converts is decreasing. Even within the ranks of
Japanese Christianity is a strongly marked tendency
to replace foreign by native teachers, and to nationalise
that religion by robbing it of many dogmas which are
elsewhere regarded as essential. The case of the
Dōshisha, which has been of late years a burning
question among Japanese and American Christians,
is one with which all who take an interest in mission
work should certainly be well acquainted, for it furnishes
a striking illustration of the appropriative and,
to our ideas, somewhat unscrupulous proclivities of
Nipponean patriots. The Dōshisha is a Christian
university founded at Kyōto in 1875 under the
auspices of the American Board Mission. So liberal
were the contributions of foreign believers to this
very flourishing institution, that at last it came to
include, besides a special theological department, a
girls’ school, a science school, a hospital, and a nurses’
training school. Needless to say, the Presbyterian
donors inserted a clause in the constitution to the
effect that their form of faith should be perpetually
and obligatorily taught. Religious schools, however,
cannot claim the same privileges as civil schools from
the Home Department, which, on the plea of neutrality,
only grants to undenominational ones special
concessions with regard to military conscription.
Realising that this disability acted unfavourably on
the number of pupils and retarded the expansion of
their work, the governing body of the Dōshisha proceeded
to increase the number of native subscribers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and with their connivance to dechristianise the college,
in order to escape the disadvantage already mentioned.
That is, the Christian instruction was made optional
instead of obligatory, but the buildings and appliances,
bought with American money, were of course retained.
The Board, representing the original subscribers, protested
against what they did not hesitate to characterise
as a flagrant breach of faith: the governing
body pleaded expediency, and were prepared to redefine
Christianity in accordance with their own conceptions
of an undeniably vague term. There the
matter rests. It might seem unfair to lay stress on
this matter, were it not that this action of the Dōshisha
authorities is typical of the attitude of native educationalists
at the present time to foreign teaching: it
forms, in fact, part of the patriotic movement, which I
desire to indicate without praise or blame, more especially
as that movement is so little known outside
Japan. Of course, there has been for years a very
natural and proper tendency to replace foreign by
native officials as soon as the latter seemed capable
of discharging the functions primarily entrusted to the
former. But this is very different from denying to
foreigners the right of founding schools at their own
risk&mdash;a right which they would enjoy as a matter of
course in any but reactionary States. Such, however,
is the policy urged on the Government by the
Higher Educational Council (composed of professors
in the chief schools and colleges), which on April 17,
1899, passed the following resolution:</p>

<p>“Foreigners who are not conversant with Japanese
shall not be allowed to become teachers in other courses
than those of foreign languages or special courses in
special schools and of schools exclusively intended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
foreigners. <em>Foreigners who are licensed as teachers in
the above-mentioned capacities shall not be allowed to
found schools other than those exclusively intended for
foreigners.</em>”</p>

<p>As the founder of a school should legally be a
licensed teacher, the foregoing clauses practically prohibit
foreigners from establishing schools for Japanese.
Besides, there is a clause prohibiting religious education
and ceremonies in privileged schools. In other
words, the nationalists wish education to be not only
in their own hands, but also entirely secular; and those
who desire to introduce from abroad theological tenets
may no longer do so, if the Government should follow
this advice, except from the pulpit or as private individuals.
Whether such a restriction be or be not in
violation of existing treaties with foreign Powers, I
cannot say.</p>

<p>Sufficient proof has perhaps been already adduced
of anti-foreign feeling to convince an impartial reader
that an Anglo-Saxon exile has some reason for feeling
ill at ease in the tourists’ paradise. It might be added,
however, that even the victim of patriotic manœuvres
is hardly ever exposed to personal malevolence. The
politest nation in the world would certainly not be
guilty of any overt discourtesy. The accident of
foreign birth may place you outside the pale of those
secure and intimate relations which you might form
with colleagues in other lands (the divergence of social
and domestic habits by itself almost necessitates this),
but, if the collision of financial interests should result
in your ejection from a post of vantage, you cannot
justly blame an individual, only those centripetal forces
that give solidarity and cohesion to a race which
remains, the more it changes, the more indissolubly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the same. And though the patriot might think, he
would never say to your face, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’étranger, voilà
l’ennemi.</span>” On the contrary, if he had not the racial
interest to consider, if he were not born in a maze of
reciprocal duties which to us are inconceivable, so
charming is his natural disposition that I am <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'not a all sure'">not at
all sure</ins> that he would not, now and then, sacrifice
himself to oblige an alien!</p>

<p>I have used the phrase “charming natural disposition”
deliberately, though it may seem incongruous,
or even incompatible with dislike of strangers. What
traveller has not felt and described this charm? Will
Adams in the beginning of the seventeenth century
found “the people of this Iland good of nature, curteous
aboue measure,” and Sir Rutherford Alcock in
the middle of the nineteenth reports them “as kindly
and well-disposed people as any in the world.” Has
their nature, then, suffered any deterioration? Has
contact with Europeans and Americans brought material
gain at the cost of ethical loss? Many observers,
both native and foreign, declare this to be the case:
a little reflection will show that it cannot, for the
present, be otherwise.</p>

<p>“Old Japan,” in the opinion of Mr. Lafcadio Hearn,
“was quite as much in advance of the nineteenth century
morally as she was behind materially. She had
made morality instinctive.” This verdict is not yet of
purely historic interest; it may be tested by all who
care to travel beyond the radius of photographs and
railways. In remote districts, where the innkeeper
charges a minimum price, relying for profit on the
generosity of his guest, whose present is acknowledged
by the bestowal of a fan or an embroidered towel, even
such fugitive relations rest on a benevolent rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a wholly commercial basis. Patriarchal manners&mdash;contented
submission, fidelity, courtesy&mdash;yield a rich
return of domestic happiness. The struggle for life
and for wealth is tempered by self-sacrificing customs
and amenities. If the apprentice be willing to work
for no other wage than his master’s approval and
satisfaction through long probationary years, the
master, on his side, will resign his charge into the
hands of a younger generation before decrepitude has
come to rob “honourable retirement” of its grace. If
the young wife devote her summer to unquestioning
service of her husband and his parents, she has
her reward when her sons’ wives repay her with the
same filial homage. Similar ties, imposing restraint
on egoism and sanctified by public esteem, have had
their full share in developing those amiable qualities
which every observer has acknowledged. But the
break-up of feudal society cannot fail to react on the
manners which reflected feudal discipline. The
Western ideals of liberty, equality, and self-assertion,
the decay of religious belief, the necessity of fighting
on even terms in the great competitive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> to the
tune of “The devil take the hindmost, oh!” and, it
must be added, the example set by the rest of the
world, which does not practise altruism, whatever its
representatives may preach, all these factors tend to
harden and sharpen the modernised Japanese.</p>

<p>A curious sign of the independent spirit, nourished
on new ideas and strangely at variance with the old, is
the organised indiscipline of schoolboys. During the
six months which the writer spent in the country two
flagrant cases occurred of defiance of authority, by no
means unusual, it would appear, in scholastic experience,
if one might judge by the comments of the local Press.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
In one case the majority of the scholars absented
themselves for a fortnight as a protest against the
alleged incapacity of the teacher, and maltreated a
more docile minority who endeavoured to resume
their lessons. In another the upper forms refused
to recognise the authority of a headmaster appointed
by the Government, on the ground that his talents
and attainments fell below the standard which they
deemed desirable in the director of their studies. In
consequence, the unfortunate nominee of the Minister
of Education was completely boycotted; his class-room
was deserted, his suggestions ignored; and, on the
occasion of the annual prize-giving, he was publicly
insulted, for, whereas the whole school rose and
remained standing as a mark of respect during the
speeches of distinguished visitors, when their unfortunate
chief began his address they resumed their
seats and engaged in loud conversation, after the
manner of our own House of Commons when the
suppression of an unwelcome orator is desired. The
most surprising feature in both these instances was
that a section of the Japanese Press, instead of
regarding the incidents as deplorable, indeed, but as
domestic matters, which it concerned only the governing
body to regulate, made them the subject of a long
polemic, sided with or against the malcontents, and, in
short, exalted the revolting schoolboys into fellow-citizens
“rightly struggling to be free.” The college
Hampden does not shrink from his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i>, and is prepared
in the interests of curiosity and “the higher education”
to cross-examine a newly-appointed professor, insufficiently
protected by a Harvard or Oxford reputation,
on his knowledge of Shakespeare, his theological
beliefs, his preference for “the open door” or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
gradual partition of China. If this precocious independence
conflict with our old-fashioned notions of
modesty and reverence on the part of adolescence
towards its seniors, it should make life more amusing
for the professor, who, after all, is better off with
inquisitive than with incurious pupils. I am confirmed
in my supposition that the autonomous schoolboy is
not at all abnormal by a schoolmaster of nearly ten
years’ standing, who writes: “In the Occident the
master expels the pupil. In Japan it happens quite
as often that the pupil expels the master. Each public
school is an earnest, spirited little republic.” One
thing is certain. The taught are as eager to absorb
knowledge as the teacher to impart it; idleness is rare;
without extraordinary application but little progress
can be made. For it should not be forgotten that four
or five years must be devoted to the sole acquisition
of a working stock of Chinese ideographs, the scholar’s
needlessly complicated alphabet, before he attacks
Western science, law, language, or medicine themselves
supplementary to subjects of native growth. Demands
so various can only be met by the most systematic
precision, and in effect no country has more carefully
organised popular education. To organise comes
naturally to the Japanese, and this capacity explains
the apparent contradiction of co-existent order and
revolt. The revolt is always corporate, one organisation
within another. Whether the disaffected body
consist of waiters, or workmen, or schoolboys, it has to
be treated as a collective unit. The objects pursued&mdash;higher
wages, more liberty, more privileges&mdash;may
bear the impress of democratic ambition, but the spirit
in which they are fought for is that of feudal obedience
to a common call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be said that the Japanese Press has degenerated
through contact with foreigners, since it is
a plant, imported from abroad nearly thirty years
ago, which has thriven and multiplied exceedingly on
favourable soil. As might have been expected, no
modern novelty is more popular than the newspaper
in a land where gossip and laughter and criticism are
as the breath of life to a sharp-witted, good-tempered
race. More than a thousand newspapers&mdash;several
illustrated, some wholly or partly in English&mdash;cater
at very low prices to the public appetite. It is natural
that the right to speak and print freely should be
liable to abuse when first exercised. Nor could the
wary group of reformers, whose task of nursing democratic
institutions among hereditary partisans of a
rigid caste system was no less delicate than difficult,
be blamed for setting legal limits to editorial indiscretion.
In India and in Egypt the British authorities
are often compelled for reasons of State to quench the
sacred torch of incendiary invective. But as public
opinion grows better educated, it is less liable to be
led astray by journalistic tirades. Moreover, the
journalist soon acquires a hold, direct or indirect, on
the Legislature, wherever Parliament and Press become
interdependent. The Press laws of Japan have,
in consequence, lost much of their severity, and
the “prison-editor” (whose position corresponds to
that of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sitz-Redaktör</i> in Prussia) finds his fate of
vicarious imprisonment, when the actual editor sins,
grow daily less onerous. It was, indeed, urged as a
reproach by opposition sheets against the Okuma-Itagaki
Ministry of 1898 that five or six of the
Ministers had been at some time or other inmates
of his Imperial Majesty’s gaols; but the gravity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the reproach is much diminished by the explanation
that in nearly every case incarceration had been
inflicted for unguarded liberty of expression in the
Press or on the platform. Political offences, all the
world over, are merely political offences. For the
Irish Nationalist Kilmainham is more sacred than
Westminster. Such prisoners are no more than
naughty children, locked in a dark room by a paternal
Government.</p>

<p>But, in truth, it is not the political columns which
have most influence on the circulation of Tōkyō
journals. If the typical leading article <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'seem to English'">seems to English</ins>
taste wanting in force and directness, abounding in
vague sonorities, that is a fault shared by European
editors, who are bound to veil an oracle with traditional
obscurity. This trait is, of course, intensified by the
impersonal periphrases of the language. Where the
director of the journal is most to blame is in allowing
his organ to become the medium of worse than
American personalities. The newspaper which enjoys
the largest circulation among the middle and lower
classes of the capital devotes much attention to maintaining
the prestige of its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chronique scandaleuse</i>. The
Prime Minister, the foreign merchant or professor, the
Buddhist high-priest, will discover that his amours,
embellished with corroborative detail and treated with
more regard to artistic effect than the facts warrant,
command the most flattering and embarrassing popularity.
What would be thought of a London newspaper
which should record so minutely the movements of a
visiting prince as to chronicle the names of professional
beauties visited by him, as well as the price paid
for their transitory favours? The aggrieved hero or
villain has no doubt legal remedy, should he choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to prosecute the offending reporter; but the remedy
would be worse than the disease, since not only is it
dilatory and expensive, but the protracted advertisement
would tend to circulate rather than to kill the
slander. Besides, in the eyes of an indulgent public
gallantry, as our French neighbours call it, excites
more amusement then reprobation. At any rate,
libellous paragraphs, with their inevitable accompaniment
of blackmail, are at present sufficiently numerous
to detract from the high reputation deservedly enjoyed
by more scrupulous journals such as the <cite>Nihon</cite>, the
<cite>Nichi Nichi</cite>, and the <cite>Jiji Shimpo</cite>. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuilleton</i>
flourishes. When illustrated by woodcuts, representing
a Japanese woman tied naked to a tree and
assaulted by Russian sailors, it makes good fuel for
chauvinistic flame; but such outrages on taste are
rare, and in general the reader prefers adventurous
romance, with a spice of unreality, in the vein of Jules
Verne or the elder Dumas.</p>

<p>Proximity to the continent where manners count
for less than dollars has, in the opinion of many, made
the present generation less polite and more mercenary
than its predecessors. One certainly misses the
exquisite courtesy still in vogue in outlying districts,
when one has occasion to remark the rudeness or
familiarity of certain classes in or near Tōkyō. But
this declining courtesy, which cannot be called general,
is not to be attributed solely to ignorant dislike of
strangers. As soon as the sensitive native discovers
that ceremonious attention is apt to be mistaken for
obsequiousness, his pride intervenes and his bearing
becomes less affable. The example of ill-mannered
tourists has, it is true, demoralised the service of
certain hotels, where the visitor persists in regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the attendant <em>musumé</em> as a plaything, but the incivility
of the rickshaw-man when his invariable attempt to
overcharge is frustrated rests on no other basis than
the presumption, not confined to one country, that
since the traveller has arrived to spend money, he
should be encouraged to spend it as freely as possible.
Sometimes, too, an amusing reciprocal patronage is to
be observed. If the tourist be inclined to regard the
peasant as a living toy invented for his diversion, the
peasant not infrequently will see in the tourist a helpless,
rather childish creature, pleased by infantile things
and unable to speak a word of Japanese. He therefore
pities, protects, and fleeces him. None but the incapable
rich, whom vanity or idleness compels to become
dependent on inferiors, should dream of employing a
professional guide. He probably is less well informed
than “Murray”; he seeks on every pretext to prolong
his services; he exacts a commission on every purchase
made, both from his employer and the shopkeeper, for
if the latter refuse he will conduct the customer elsewhere.
Notwithstanding these peculiarities, he is
perhaps worth his price to hurried visitors.</p>

<p>How far materialism has gone in replacing dutiolatry
by worship of the golden calf, to what extent the old
high ideals have ceased to affect the relations of the
Japanese to one another&mdash;such a question is difficult,
perhaps impossible, to answer satisfactorily. Mr.
B. H. Chamberlain declares roundly that “patriotism
is the only ideal left,” but on such a nice point it is
better to let the native speak for himself.</p>

<p>From <cite>The Orient</cite>, a monthly magazine, Buddhistic
in sympathy and of modern tendency, is quoted the
following unequivocal indictment:</p>

<p>“Spiritually there is very undeniable decadence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Open ports, huge fleets of steamers, thousands of miles
of rails, telephone and telegraph wires, a navy ranking
at least seventh in the world’s list, a consolidated
postal system, flourishing banks, and all else of like
nature, are nothing more than signs of material progress.
Like our allies, we have grown worldly wise,
and have come to view the almighty dollar with a
feeling akin to veneration. People point, and with
justice, to the tremendous social revolution of the
Restoration days; but where we have got rid of <em>daimyō</em>
and <em>shōmyō</em>, of <em>hatamoto</em> and <em>samurai</em>, have we not
plutocrats and bureaucrats as potent and unconscionable
as the most tyrannical of the one-time feudal
barons? The outcast pariahs&mdash;the <em>eta</em>&mdash;no longer
exist in law or name; but they exist in fact. The
operatives of the Ōsaka mills, the wretched human
shambles of the prostitute quarters, the sick and suffering
poor&mdash;are these not social pariahs and even worse?
We miss the sternly martial virtue of the days of yore;
the unbending dignity of the true, the real <em>Yamato-damashii</em>
(the spirit of Japanese chivalry).... Never
were bribery and corruption more rife: the whole
machinery of the State is suffering from this dry-rot;
and even those who are called upon to set the country
an example have their price. Nepotism is taking the
place of clannish interdependence. One’s fortunes are
easily made if one happens to be a ‘forty-second
cousin’ of a favourite courtesan, a popular <em>geisha</em>, or a
spoiled mistress.”</p>

<p>“Irresponsible rhetoric,” the reader may think, and
indulged in the more freely because the writer chose
to employ the English tongue, which is yet unknown
to the majority of his countrymen. But these considerations
do not apply to the official utterances of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ex-Premier (Count Okuma) and his Minister of Education.
The former, who is not chary of autobiography,
in a speech which created some sensation confessed
that as a young man he had been too dazzled by the
splendour of Western civilisation to appreciate the
seamy side of material progress, but recent experience
of popular movements and public affairs had convinced
him that the supreme need of all classes, if their
prosperity were to continue, was a return to the higher
morality of the past. Mr. Hayashi, who may be
thought to have interpreted his duty of directing
national education too literally, put the matter in a nutshell.
“Let us suppose,” said he to a popular audience,
“that Japan in the course of a thousand years or so
were to become a republic. If the same Mammon-worship
should exist then as exists now, it is certain
that the Vanderbilt or Jay Gould of the day would be
elected President.” Few nations care to be lectured
in this way, even by Ministers of Education. The
result was a violent agitation, fomented in the patriotic
Press, which demanded the resignation of one who
could be so disloyal to his sovereign as to hint at a
possible republic ten centuries ahead. The rash
moralist found it expedient to resign. Assuming, however,
as one is perhaps entitled to assume, that the
speaker had chiefly in mind the venality of politicians,
I doubt very much either the extent or the heinousness
of the evil denounced. Reduced to detail, the charges
amount to this: that electors and deputies have been
known to sell their votes and to advocate measures
from which they have made preparations to derive
financial benefit. Such evils are inseparable from the
infancy of representative government, and persist in
veiled form in its maturity. The Unionist member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Salisbury-Chamberlain party who has been called
upon to vote successive bounties or remission of taxes
to landed proprietors and clerical tithe-payers is guilty
of somewhat similar acts, with this trifling difference:
that instead of rewarding his supporters with money
from his own purse, he draws upon the State treasury.
It would not be surprising if Japanese politicians were
more openly corrupt than our own, for most of them
take American politics as the nearest and most friendly
school of democracy&mdash;a school where self-seeking is
avowedly the first duty of a public man, and where the
prizes fall to the cleverest manipulator or servitor of
plutocratic trusts. But, as a matter of fact, neither
Tammany nor Panama is yet transplanted to the banks
of Sumidagawa. The laws aimed at electoral bribery
are stringent and frequently enforced. Accusations of
corruption are invariably followed by official inquiry.
It is evident, then, that if the offender be sometimes
clever enough to evade discovery, at least public
opinion is neither cynical nor depraved. A stronger
negative argument is furnished by the fact that the
Liberals and Progressives (as the two anti-ministerial
parties were called until the fusion in 1898), who had
been excluded until that year from office, though constituting
on more than one occasion a majority in the
Lower House of the Diet, did not accuse the Ministers
who launched Japan on the sea of parliamentary
government of either misgovernment or dishonest
finance. Nepotism was the sum and substance of their
complaint. The Chōshi men monopolised the chief
posts in the railway department, the Satsuma men held
control of army and navy: in a word, the ascendency
of the pre-revolutionary clans survived the revolution.
But, when their own turn came in the summer of 1898<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to divide the spoils of office, to which they had been
summoned by the astuteness of Marquess Ito, prompt
to cover personal chagrin at his own defeat by advocacy
of his opponents’ claims to Imperial recognition, the
followers of Counts Okuma and Itagaki found it impossible
to reconcile the claims of contending office-seekers.
Indeed, so bitter did the dissensions become, that the
alliance was dissolved, and the first Ministry based on
a majority in the Lower House disbanded before the
Diet met. Power has since reverted to the same men,
whose sagacity has made Japan triumph alike over
armed foes and treaty-allies. Seeing that no more
than eight per cent. of the population have votes,
participation in home politics is confined to a comparatively
small circle; and not to all of them, since most of
the merchants with whom I conversed on the subject
were content to leave their interests in the hands of
the authorities, and expressed great resentment at the
action of the <em>sōshi</em> or professional agitators employed
by politicians to cajole or threaten a constituency. It
is inevitable at present that place and power should be
the goal of all parties, and that politics should present
the aspect of a scramble for office. There is no
dividing-line between political parties, as elsewhere.
No one desires to return to the feudal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, or to
tamper with the Constitution, or to limit the royal
prerogative. In the face of national danger it is easy
for all parties to unite, since nothing divides them but
such questions as the incidence of taxation and the distribution
of posts. In the course of time, should the
last vestige of acquiescent docility on the part of the
toilers be swept away, the industrial sphinx will pose
its question to the Japanese as to all other modern
communities; the rich will be ranged against the poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the socialist against the conservative. But, as things
are now, even the loss of diplomatic prestige occasioned
by the triumph of Russia in Manchuria, of which the
blame cannot justly be assigned to isolated Japan, is
counterbalanced by the careful development of military
and commercial resources which would seem the crowning
duty of the Emperor’s advisers. The increasing
prosperity of the country is the best answer to malevolent
critics, and, if the charge of spiritual decadence
in politics is to be sustained, weightier evidence must
be produced than the writer has been able to discover.</p>

<p>Well, I have taken a bird’s-eye view of the Japanese
as they appear to the resident alien, because his
protesting voice is generally drowned in the joyful
ejaculations of passing travellers. I have put aside for
the moment my own prepossessions, which were only
strengthened by intercourse with natives of every
class, in order that the dark side of the shield might
not be veiled. Dishonest traders aided by tortuous
enactments, and mistrustful teachers suspicious of
Western propaganda, insubordinate inferiors and incompetent
officials&mdash;all these constitute grave stumbling-blocks
to happiness; But it would not be fair
to ignore the facts which promise a brighter future.
There are many firms whose integrity is unquestioned,
many journalists who try to stem the current
of national misunderstanding by sagacious counsel.
Experience and fuller knowledge are sure to prove
wholesome correctives. The anti-foreign bias, though
real and formidable, is based on the fear of half-understood
eventualities. Closer intercourse and wider education
will cause wisdom to spread down from the
rulers to the ruled, who are not yet on familiar terms
with our conceptions of trade and government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be hoped, when the nation feels thoroughly
at home in its new house, equipped from garret to
cellar with the latest improvements and occupied by a
tenant-proprietor whom no conceivable machination of
jealous neighbours can dislodge, that even the foreign
lodger will be permitted to exercise his calling without
the slightest hindrance or disability.</p>

<p>So much for the world behind the scenes, of which
a glimpse has been vouchsafed to the reader. It will
be seen that those who sustain <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôles</i> in the daintiest
of comediettas are also cast for a problem-play; that
they are no more exempt from envy, hatred, and
vanity than other sensitive artists; that their professional
dislike to alien amateurs, who add insult to
injury by expecting the deference due to higher
national status while competing for the pence and
plaudits of the same public, is very human and not
without excuse; that, in spite of these infirmities, they
may be industrious bread-winners and excellent performers.
After all, the proper place for sightseers is
the front of the house. Let us go there, and forget
the intrigues of the green-room, in which we have
happily no concern. We have come many miles to
witness the play; let us give it undivided attention.</p>

<h2 class="no-brk"><a name="NOTE_TO_BEHIND" id="NOTE_TO_BEHIND"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">NOTE TO “BEHIND THE SCENES.” CASSANDRA
JUSTIFIED?</a></h2>


<p>Though time and space had so muffled the protesting shrieks of
Cassandra that I could no longer hear her whirling prophecies or
follow her sorry fortunes from day to day in the chivalrous Press
of the treaty-ports, I never lost interest or sympathy in her loudly
predicted future. I would picture her borne with streaming eyes and
hair from her extra-territorial temple; I would ask myself whether
she had yet been borne off into bondage unspeakable by some
Japanese Agamemnon. News travels slowly, and I was forced to
content myself with the most meagre reports, when one day came a
letter with the Yokohama postmark, in which the writer took exception
to some statements made by me in a lecture to the Playgoers’
Club on the subject of Japanese theatres, and improved the occasion
by despatching much irrelevant information on the subject of Japanese
iniquity. I owe a heavy debt of gratitude to Mr. F. Schroeder, the
editor and proprietor of <cite>The Eastern World</cite>, for those letters and
pamphlets. They assure me of the welcome fact that Cassandra is
alive and free, and protesting more loudly than ever. I gladly give
publicity to the incidents and speculations recorded in them, for,
while they seem to justify honest apprehension on the part of
Cassandra’s friends, they also contain indications that Agamemnon
is by no means so subject to Thersites as the foes of Far Eastern
democracy would have us believe.</p>

<p>The question which raises most speculation, on account of the uncertainty
of the law to be applied, is also the most important. It
concerns leasehold. Hitherto foreigners had supposed themselves
to hold land under a perpetual lease on payment of a lump sum to
the vendor and of annual ground-rent to the Government. But,
when a recent application was made to the local court in Yokohama
for the registration of the transfer of property so held from one
British subject to another, the Court replied that it had no power to
register such a transfer, offering instead to describe the property as
a perpetual superficies. The offer was refused and the point submitted
to the British Minister. If it should be decided that the
foreign owner is no more than a superficiary, the ground at a distance
of more than thirty feet below the surface tacitly reverts to the
Government, which of course would have the right to sell it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mining purposes, for the construction of tunnels or reservoirs or what
not, provided that the surface were neither entered nor broken. A
change so radical in the conditions of holding land, which the purchaser
may thus have acquired under a misapprehension, is serious
enough, but more serious still will be its effect on future purchasers.
By the newly codified law authorisation is refused to leases of longer
than twenty years’ duration. What foreign firm, desirous of a permanent
footing on Japanese soil, would erect buildings and establish
itself on land liable to be resumed by the owner at the end of so
short a period? How easy for native traders under such circumstances
to strangle or arrest the business of alien competitors!
Should a score of years demonstrate the growth of too successful
rivalry, they have merely to bring such pressure to bear on the lessor
as would prevent renewal of the lease.</p>

<p>The <em>Tamba Maru</em> case, which originated in a somewhat ignoble
squabble between the English third officer and the Japanese quartermaster
of a Nippon Yusen Kwaisha steamer, assumes quite Homeric
proportions in the pages of an <cite>Eastern World</cite> brochure. It certainly
affords food for reflection on the methods of Oriental justice when
racial prejudice intervenes, but the sequel shows that in Japan at any
rate an appeal lies from prejudiced judges and partial witnesses to
substantial wisdom and common-sense in high places. The facts
are few and stirring. Horace Robert Kent had reported Umeseko
Toyomatsu for smoking while on duty. His inexperienced eye had
mistaken the glow of a jewel in the latter’s ring for the glint of a
cigarette. Fearful of losing his captain’s good opinion and his place
on board, the injured innocent invaded the mate’s cabin with his
cap on and flashed the exculpating jewel in that officer’s face.
Hand-to-hand scuffling ensued, of which contradictory accounts are
naturally given, with the result that Toyomatsu received a black eye,
was put in irons, and released at once to mollify his comrades, while
Mr. Kent was bitten five or six times in the thigh and hidden by his
prudent skipper from the vengeance of the crew. Each brought a
charge of assault against the other. At the trial the evidence of
eye-witnesses seems to have been entirely eclipsed by the opinions of
medical gentlemen, who deserve the honours of the verdict. Dr.
Sagara opined that a black eye (the organ not even being closed up)
would prevent a sailor from work for more than twenty days, and
would take from three to four weeks to heal completely; Dr. Fujise
compared the wounds in the thigh of the third mate with the shape
of the quartermaster’s teeth, and found that they almost completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
coincided, but was still unable to assert that they were caused by
biting. Sentences: six months’ rigorous imprisonment for the
Englishman, five days’ detention for the Japanese. The inequality
of the punishments was quickly remedied. The Tōkyō Court of
Appeal quashed the decision of the original tribunal, and reduced the
sentence from six months’ imprisonment to ten days’ detention. I
dwell at some length on this trivial case of common assault for two
reasons. First, it is satisfactory to remark how promptly an excess
of partial severity was corrected; secondly, I feel sure that Mr.
Kent is the only foreigner on whom the evil foretold by Cassandra
has fallen within six months of the coming into operation of the
treaties. Otherwise I should have received other and more indignant
pamphlet-homilies on the baneful fulfilment of prophecy.</p>

<p>Finally, my informant calls attention to recent cases of official
bribery and corruption. He cites the name of Mr. Koyama
Konosuke, M.P., who was charged in Parliament with receiving a
bribe of 2000 <em>yen</em> from the Government of the day (1899), and who,
so far from denying it, sued in a court of law for the remainder of
the money due to him. Being called upon by his constituents to
resign, he replied with a threat of exposing implicated colleagues, and
apparently retained his seat. Both Houses of the Legislature would
seem to be tainted by similar practices, for <cite>The Japan Mail</cite> (of
April 10, 1900) has a paragraph, headed “The Peers Scandal,” to the
following effect:</p>

<p>“It is now alleged that no less than twenty-four members of the
House of Peers are implicated in the bribery scandal connected with
the Religious Bill affair. Some of them are alleged to be desirous of
hushing up the matter, but their fellow-members insist that something
must be done to clear the reputation of the House. It is impossible
to tell how much truth there may be in these rumours.”</p>

<p>It is obviously “impossible” for a foreigner to collect such proofs
of corruption as would be good evidence in a court of law, nor, if
possible, would it be worth his while. The cry of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vendu</i> is so freely
bandied by a factionist Press, that, remembering the famous legend
of a Dreyfus syndicate, one hesitates to pin faith on vague paragraphs.
Moreover, whatever foundation of fact underlie the charges,
it should be borne in mind that parliamentary government has only
existed for ten years, and it would not be reasonable to expect in a
decade those virtues which were of very slow growth in our own
Mother of Parliaments. Corruption at Pretoria or St. Petersburg is
no bar to “the sympathies of the civilised world” (outside Anglo-Saxondom),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and in any case these evils may safely be left for correction
to those whom they most immediately concern. The Japanese
Press is conscious of them, anxious to deal with them; the laws are
stringent enough, if difficult to enforce. One notes them as a factor
in Japanese politics to be neither exaggerated nor ignored, and turns
to consider less purely domestic matters.</p>

<p>Indirect confirmation of my impression that Christianity was losing
ground in the country is furnished by the elaborate report of the
American Board of Foreign Missions, of which the rose-coloured
conclusions at first sight suggest the contrary. Stress is laid, for
instance, on the fact that a prominent Christian was elected to the
present Diet by a majority of five to one in Buddhist Kyōto; but
there is nothing to show that the election turned on doctrinal issues.
One Japanese Christian was appointed “moral teacher” in the
Sugamo penitentiary, with the result that all the rest, Buddhists by
faith, resigned. Political reasons probably caused this appointment,
for Sugamo is the prison to which all foreign delinquents will be sent
under the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>. The Board complains of strong opposition
to the teaching of the elements of the Christian religion, not only in
public but also in private schools, centred in the Education Department,
and attributes it to widespread agnosticism, which, so far as it
desires to conserve Buddhist influence, does so for ulterior social
and intellectual ends. But I find the clearest proof of simultaneous
success and failure in the admission that Christianity maintains its
hold by practical philanthropy. Schools for neglected and criminal
children, schemes for relieving discharged prisoners, benevolent works
of all kinds, are promoted and carried out by Christians. Of goodness
of this sort the kind-hearted Japanese are thoroughly appreciative,
but it is the works, not the faith, which they admire. Holders
of all creeds, or of none, must sympathise with this aspect of missionary
effort; but it results, and perhaps happily, in a closer union
of hearts than of minds.</p>

<p>I conclude with a quotation from the <cite>Jiji</cite>, one of the most influential
Tōkyō papers&mdash;a quotation which speaks for itself and accords with
the sorrowful vaticinations of Cassandra:</p>

<p>“<em>Decrease in the Number of Foreign Residents.</em>&mdash;Quite contrary to
expectations, there seems to be a gradual reduction in the number
of foreigners residing in Yokohama, where they are more numerous
than in any other part of the country. It is anticipated that the
statistics will perhaps show some reduction for two or three years.
The reason is supposed to be: (1) foreigners prefer Hongkong or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Shanghai to Japan, owing to the difficulty of finding opportunities
for gaining as large profits as formerly; and (2) their unfamiliarity
with the Japanese law, which imposes undue restraint upon their
movements. As a matter of fact, they have been surprised by the
imposition of heavy taxes of various kinds, never dreamt of previously.
Moreover, in consequence of the coming into operation of
the new tariff, they have been deprived of their profits on certain
kinds of goods, such as liquors, cigars, &amp;c. This is shown by the
circumstance that the foreign merchants who have given up or are
going to give up business are mostly dealers in these goods. In
future foreigners who may be induced to come to this part of the
world can only be, in consequence of the operation of the new
treaties, those who have other objects than business and who will
take the place of the present residents, who will certainly leave in the
near future.”</p>

<p class="noindent">The traveller who witnesses a “<em>Nō</em> Dance,” hastily
improvised for his amusement at the Maple Club of
Tōkyō, or who chances upon a pantomimic duologue
in grotesque costume, rendered on a rough platform to
divert the crowd before a temple at the <em>matsuri</em>&mdash;half
fair, half festival&mdash;can really form no idea of the exquisite
little dramas which for more than five centuries
have been performed privately in the houses of
Japanese nobles and are still enacted at rare intervals
to an invited audience. The common term “<em>Nō</em>
Dance” is rather misleading, since it only suggests the
rhythmic posturing of the characters&mdash;very graceful, it
is true, and pregnant with meaning for the initiated&mdash;but
ignores other factors, such as the words, the story,
and the music, which contribute quite as memorably
to the total effect. Operetta will not do, since the
choric strains, which stimulate attention and intensify
emotion with their staccato accompaniment, are subordinate
throughout. If, then, that may be styled a
play which revolves on a single episode and relates
to no more than three or four persons, a very close
parallel lies between these and the religious plays of
Europe. In both you find the same reverence for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
past, dictating the devout demeanour of actors and
audience; in both a minute traditional interpretation,
governing the diction, the action, and the dress; in
both a perpetual association of the scenes depicted
with sacred legends and the spirit world. But whereas
Christianity yields one and the same drama, once in a
decade, to the peasants of Oberammergau, the Shintōist
Pantheon, sanctifying national history and full of deified
heroes, appeals to both patriotic and religious instincts
through the medium of an art sometimes immature
but always refined.</p>

<p>The roots of this musical pantomime reach far back
into mythological times. The figure of the Terrible
Female of Heaven, stamping on an inverted tub to
startle the Sun Goddess from her cave, is generally
invoked on the threshold of inquiries into the origin
of <em>Kagura</em>, or temple-dancing. Grotesque and venerable,
it is not illuminating. More startling to me
is the statement of a modern authority that “in the
eighth century, in the later period of the Nara dynasty
and at the beginning of the Heian period, combining
the Korean and the Chinese music with the native, a
certain perfect form of Japanese music came to exist.”
To comprehend this “perfect music,” as rendered on
drum, fife, and flute, esoteric education is required.
But it may be admitted that certain Wagnerian effects
of terror and suspense and tumultuous agitation are
thumped and wailed into the auditor, while his ocular
attention is absorbed by deliberate phantoms. Very
deliberate are the phantom dancers, whether their
theme be simple or complex. On the dancing stages
at the Shintō temples of Ise and of Omi, on the four
platforms of the Kasuga Temple at Nara, the subject
was naturally mythological or had relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
temple’s own history. Such songs as went with the
dance were simple, short, and primitive. They would
be heard at Court ceremonies, too, for the union of
Church and State was close. They were sung by
members of privileged families, who guarded and transmitted
from father to son the professional secrets of
their “perfect music.”</p>

<p>However, the beginning of the Ashikaga period in
the fourteenth century saw the corruption and development
of a perfect germ into complex variety. Both
sacred and secular rivalry contributed to this result.
The <em>Biwa-hōshi</em>, blind priests and lute-players, who
went from castle to castle of the Daimyōs, singing <em>Heike-monogatari</em>,
historical romances of warlike quality in
prose and verse, opened new vistas of subject-matter,
while <em>Shirabyōshi</em>, the refined and cultivated precursor
of the comparatively modern geisha, extended both
the scope and the significance of posture-dancing.
The <em>Kioku-mai</em>, or memory-dance, came into vogue,
being characterised by closer co-ordination of music
and movement, while the accompanying song would
often celebrate a romantic episode or a famous landscape.
Many of these songs survive, embedded in the
chorus of <em>Nō</em> texts; in fact, they may be regarded as
the nucleus of <em>Nō</em> drama.</p>

<p>The Muromachi Shōgunate witnessed the final transition
from dance to drama, recitative and singing
speeches and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> being superadded to
the chorus. Kiyotsugu (who died in 1406) and his
son Motokiyo (who died in 1455) are generally credited
with this development. They belonged to the Yusaki
family&mdash;one of the four families who exercised hereditary
management of the Nara stage. They held a
small estate, and succeeded in winning the Shōgun’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
patronage for their <em>Sarugaku</em> or <em>Nō</em>, which became
extremely popular at Court. Naturally enough, the
choric songs became panegyrics of the reigning Shōgun,
and helped to embellish his Court pageants.</p>

<p>It is not believed that the actor-manager did more
than prepare and conduct the <em>Nō</em>, in which music and
dancing were still the chief features. The author was
contented to remain anonymous, and that for good
reasons. Intellectual light shone mostly in the monasteries
during that dark age of feudal fighting. If
the Buddhist monk could make of this aristocratic
amusement a vehicle for Buddhist teaching, individual
obscurity was a small price to pay for corporate
influence. Therefore, while it cannot be stated as a
fact that the famous priests Ikkiu and Shiuran wrote
the finest <em>Nō</em> poetry, it is certain that <em>yurei</em> or ghosts
and Buddhist exorcisers became very common characters
on the <em>Nō</em> boards, while the chorus betrayed
(as I am told) “many deep conceptions of mystic
religion.” What higher compliment has ever been
paid to art, dramatic or pictorial, than the struggles of
priests and politicians to wield its influence? There is
something pathetic in this aspect of the rivalry for
Terpsichore’s hand. At first she wore the red trousers
of a Shintō priestess and was wooed by the Mikado.
Then the Shōgun came, a strong man armed, and with
him she danced into the Buddhist camp.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century gave the final touch to this
musical drama, which approximated more and more to
secular plays without ever entirely losing its official
character. The ghosts faded out, the Buddhist influence
grew less marked, for it had to traverse the
tyranny of Nobunaga, who patronised Christianity and
destroyed the monasteries of Hiei-zan. But henceforward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as an aristocratic institution, the <em>Nō</em> was to
retain its popularity, though since the sixteenth century
none have been written. A programme is still extant
on which the two greatest names in Japanese history,
those of Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu, star the list of
performers. The actors were treated as <em>samurai</em>,
military retainers, though the performers in popular
<em>shibai</em> (theatres) were held in contempt. In the latest
specimens knighthood is the invariable theme, set to
more various music and illustrated by more violent
posturing.</p>

<p>Throughout the Tokugawa era (1602&ndash;1868) every
Daimyō who could afford it maintained a troupe of <em>Nō</em>
players to reproduce for his edification the thoughts
and habits of mediæval art. Old costumes, old masks,
old music were faithfully preserved; no innovation of
text or interpretation was allowed by the hereditary
custodians and directors. And since the shock of the
Restoration a reaction has set in, favouring their revival.</p>

<p>At present there are in Tōkyō six troupes of <em>Nō</em>
players, with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répertoire</i> of from two to three hundred
plays. These retain so firm a hold on cultured conservatives&mdash;the
younger generation finds them slow&mdash;that
Mr. Matsumoto Keichi, one of the leading
publishers, is now issuing a series of one hundred and
eighty-three illustrative colour prints&mdash;<em>Nō no ye</em>&mdash;whose
fine drawing and delicately blent hues are as
superior to the flamboyant aniline horror by which the
Nihon-bashi print-seller advertises the newest blood-and-thunder
melodrama as that itself is inferior to the
aristocratically-nurtured <em>Nō</em>. Reproduced as faithfully
as may be, the pictures of Mr. Kogyo will, I
hope, impress the reader with the archaic simplicity
and beauty of the original design, provided that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have the gift of sympathetic intuition, so as to divine
what tale of terror, what burden of grief, obscure to
him, is yet manifest enough behind quaint mask and
rigid gesture to the heirs of national hagiology. The
solemnity and pathos of each dramatised incident in
the life of hero or saint is emphasised by the time-honoured
locutions of mediæval Japanese, which of
course convey by mere association, as Elizabethan
English to us, the tone and atmosphere of dead centuries.
Yet, independently of the musical old speech,
so cumbrous and so courteous, it is impossible to miss
the meaning of these tiny tragedies, enacted as they
are by instinctive masters of gesticular eloquence.
The writer was particularly fortunate in gaining admission
to a series of <em>Nō</em> produced by the Umewaka
company or society, which has this advantage over the
other five organisations, diverging on points of textual
accuracy and stage ritual, that it traces unbroken
descent through its chief from the Kanza school of
music appertaining to the Yusaki family of Nara.
When Commodore Perry forced open the door of the
East in 1854, hitherto closed for more than two
hundred years to Western barbarians, Mr. Umewaka
captained a little band of <em>Nō</em> players attached to the
then all-powerful household of Keiki, the last of the
Tokugawa Shōguns.</p>

<p>Then followed bloody civil war, the bombardment
of Kago-shima and Shimonoseki, and the restoration
of the Emperor to supreme power. The ex-Shōgun
immured himself, a private gentleman, in strict seclusion.
His company of players was of course disbanded,
but little by little, from rare representations
in the houses of friends to more frequent revivals,
consequent on growing fame, their erudite and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
enthusiastic chief was able to found his present very
flourishing society. One gentleman, an ex-Daimyō,
presented the troupe with a large stage of polished
pine from his dismantled castle; a second contributed
a priceless store of plays in manuscript; Mr. Umewaka
himself brought the best gift of all, profound and
practical knowledge of the stage technique, which is
curiously elaborate in spite of seeming simplicity, and
bristles with professional secrets. The orchestra
consisted on this occasion of a flute and two <em>taiko</em>,
drums shaped like a sand-glass and rapped smartly
with the open palm. At irregular intervals, timed
no doubt by the exigencies of the text, the musicians
emitted a series of staccato cries or wailing notes,
which seemed to punctuate the passion of the player
and insensibly tightened the tension of the auditor’s
nerves. In two rows of three on the right of the stage
sat the chorus, six most “reverend signiors” in the
stiff costume of Samurai, who intervened now and
again with voice and fan, the manipulation of the
latter varying with the quality of the strains assigned
to the singers. In placid moments the fan would
sway gently to and fro, rocked on the waves of quasi-Gregorian
chanting, but, when blows fell or apparitions
rose, it was planted, menacing and erect, like a danger-signal
before the choralist’s cushion. The musicians
were seated on low stools at the back of the stage
before a long screen of conventional design, in which
green pines trailed across a gold ground, harmonising
admirably with the sober blues and browns of their
<em>kimono</em>.</p>

<p>A glance at the programme gave assurance of
prolonged and varied entertainment, since no less than
five religious plays and three <em>kiōgen</em> (lit. mad words),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
or farcical interludes, were announced in the following
order:</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent">
1. <em>Shunkwan</em>, the High-Priest in Exile.<br />
2. <em>Koi no Omone</em>, the Burden of Love.<br />
3. <em>Aoi no Uye</em>, the Sick Wife.<br />
4. <em>Funa Benkei</em>, Benkei at Sea.<br />
5. <em>Tsuchigumo</em>, the Earth-Spider.<br />
</p>

<p class="pad4 noindent"><span class="pad6"><em>Kiōgen.</em></span><br />
1. <em>Kitsune-Tsuki</em>, Possession by Foxes.<br />
2. <em>Roku Jizō</em>, the Six Jizō.<br />
3. <em>Fukuro Yamabusshi</em>, the Owl-Priest.<br />
</p>

<p>By an hour before noon the audience, seated on
cushions in little pews holding four or six persons,
had composed itself to that air of thoughtful anticipation
which I had hitherto associated with devotees
of Ibsen or Wagner. Many peered through gold
spectacles at the copies of the antique text, whose
phraseology was not without difficulties even for the
scholars and artists present; the women’s faces were
far graver and more thoughtful than one usually sees
in the land of laughing <em>musumé</em>; the prevailing grey
and black worn by women and men suffered sporadic
invasions of bright colour wherever you saw children
settling, like human butterflies. For these, though
their ears availed them little, could follow with wondering
eyes the strange succession of gorgeous or
terrible figures&mdash;warriors and spectres and court-ladies&mdash;evoked
for their delight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="Plate_46" id="Plate_46"></a>
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shunkwan in exile.</div>
</div>

<p>The story of Shunkwan, however, was quite devoid
of spectacular appeal. Exiled in 1177 with other
rebellious priests by Kiyomori, the ruthless Taira
chief, to Devil’s Island (Kikai-gashima), he is discovered
celebrating with his companions an oblation
to Kumano Gongen and praying for speedy restitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>to his fatherland. Pitiful indeed is the case of these
banished suppliants, who wear the blue-and-white
hempen skirts of fishermen and whose penury is such
that they are obliged to bring the god water instead
of <em>saké</em>, sand instead of rice, and hempen fetters
instead of white prayer-cord. Kumano Gongen
hears and answers their petition. An imperial messenger
arrives from Kyōto with a letter from the
daughter of Shunkwan, announcing that the Son of
Heaven, Lord of the Land of the Rising Sun, has
been graciously pleased to recall his erring subjects,
pardoning their offences and inviting their prayers
for an expected heir to the throne. Beaming with
grateful joy, the old man now scans the imperial mandate
more closely, only to find that his own name is
omitted from the list of those forgiven. Yasugori
and Moritsuné will be taken, but he, Shunkwan, must
be left. In vain do his fellow-exiles lament and
protest; all know that the Son of Heaven’s decree
must be obeyed to the letter. Accordingly, the others
embark, while their disappointed chief falls, speechless
and hopeless, on the shore. A simple, poignant
story! So touchingly interpreted, that the primitive
and even ludicrous makeshifts of the mounting seemed
hardly incongruous! The mooring and unmooring of
the boat, for which the crudest parody in outline of
rope and wood did duty, and the final embarkation
(as represented in the picture) were gravely accomplished
in complete immunity from ill-timed laughter;
the messenger’s grotesque <em>hakama</em>, elongated trousers,
trailing a good yard behind the feet, that the wearer
might seem to walk on his knees while about his
master’s business, provoked no smile; in fact, any
trivial details and defects were swallowed up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
prodigious earnestness of the actors. The part of
Shunkwan was played by Mr. Umewaka himself with
much pathos, depending entirely on tone, carriage,
and gesture, since all facial expression is barred by the
strict convention of playing the <em>Nō</em> in masks. While
the presentation of spectres and supernatural beings
must be facilitated by this custom, since many of the
masks are masterpieces of imaginative skill, yet, where
the interest is purely human, that illusion at which all
drama aims is proportionately diminished.</p>

<p>Now came the children’s turn to laugh at the first of
the <em>kiōgen</em>, entitled <em>Kitsune Tsuki</em>, “Possession by
foxes.” Most of the comical interludes deal with rustic
stupidity or cunning, and all refer in some way to
religious belief or practice. If one may judge by the
ubiquity of his images, the fox is the most sacred
animal in Japan. No shrines are so numerous as those
of Inari, the rice-goddess, and before each stand two
white foxes, with snarling lips and teeth clenched on a
mysterious golden object, which completely baffled the
curiosity of M. Loti, though later writers declare it to
be no more than a key, symbolising the portal of
wealth unlocked by divine favour. But Inari herself
is completely eclipsed in popular awe by her attendant
foxes. It is they who, if not propitiated, ruin the rice
crop; they who have the power, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'like the weir-wolf'">like the werewolf</ins>, of
assuming human shape and of “possessing” unfortunate
beings, whose only chance of delivery lies in
exorcism by a priest. In the case of the <em>kiōgen</em> now
presented this superstition had been turned to comical
use. We learned that Farmer Tanaka had sent two
of his men into the fields with rattles to scare away
birds, laying on them many injunctions to beware of
the dæmonic fox, Kitsune, whose exploits had lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
made him the terror of that neighbourhood. The
warning is but too effectual. So full are the watchers’
minds of the dread of fox-possession, that, when their
master appears with a jug of <em>saké</em> in his hand as a
reward and refreshment after labour, they believe him
to be Kitsune, the tempter, and thrash him soundly
out of his own rice-field!</p>

<p>Some have asserted that love, the romantic and
chivalrous love of Western literature, is absent alike
from the art and letters of Japan. Nevertheless,
what could be more romantic than the title and plot of
the play, attributed to the Emperor Gohanazono though
signed by Motokiyo&mdash;“Koi no Omoni,” “The Burden
of Love”? The lover is Yamashina Shoji, an old man
of high birth, but miserably poor, to whom out of
charity has been entrusted the tending of the Emperor’s
chrysanthemums. A court-lady, seen by chance one
day as he raised his head from the flowers, inspires
a passion which he feels to be beyond hope or cure.
He confides his unhappiness to one of the courtiers,
who counsels him to carry a burden round and round
the garden many times, until, haply, the lady “seeing,
may relent.” This he does. At first the burden seems
light as air, being buoyantly borne, but gradually it
grows heavier and heavier, until at last he staggers to
the ground, crushed to death by unavailing love. Soon
after his ghost appears, a melancholy spectre with long
white hair and gown of silver-grey, with wattled staff
and eyes of hollow gold. At this point all chivalry
certainly vanishes, for the angry apparition stamps and
glares, and, shaking locks and staff, stoutly chides the
beauty for her callous cruelty. The lady does not once
intervene, but throughout the piece sits motionless, a
figure rather than a person, her eyes fixed on the burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
itself, as it lies, concrete and symbolic, wrapped in
apple-green brocade, near the front-centre of the stage.
This inclusion of a significant silent object among the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> is curiously effective. The sight of
Yamashina tottering beneath a physical weight would
have made clumsy prose of a beautiful poetic truth.
His feelings are better conveyed by the dirge-like
song and lugubrious posturing, which poverty of language
compels one to miscall a “dance.” Full of
dignity and fine gesture is the ghost’s rebuke. Slowly
revolving on his heels, or tossing back his streaming,
silvery hair, now dashing his staff upon the ground,
now raising his <em>kimono</em> sleeve slowly to hide his face,
one felt that this weird figure was expressing elemental
passion in a language more elemental than speech. I
cannot say as much for the lady, whose coronet of thin
gold with silver crescent in front and pendent pagoda-bells
on either side, surmounting a mask of singular
ugliness, seemed the fantastic headpiece of a crude idol
very foolishly idealised. But it served to illustrate, with
an irony which the imperial author had not intended,
the so grievous “burden of love.”</p>

<p>Kyōto court-life of the twelfth century, painted for
posterity in the famous, interminable pages of “Genji
Monogatari,” one of the oldest achievements of the
lady-novelist, has found less tedious and equally faithful
presentment in such dramatic miniatures as “Aoi no
Uye,” Prince Genji’s long-suffering wife. Jealousy is
the keynote of this lyrical play&mdash;that insatiable, self-torturing
jealousy which is the hardest of demons to
expel. Again I noticed a piece of curious, silent
symbolism. The poor, demoniac wife, who gives her
name to the play, does not appear, either as person or
figure: in her stead a long strip of folded brocade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
suggesting a bed of sickness, lies immediately behind
the footlights. Thus, though sub-conscious of her
entity, the spectator is compelled to focus all attention
on the apparition, which takes double form. First
comes the spirit of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Princess Rokijo, who'">Princess Rokujo, who</ins> takes
vengeance on her false lover (Genji is the Don Juan
of Japan) by haunting the helpless Aoi in the shape
of a pale wailing woman. A <em>miko</em>, or Shintō priestess,
is summoned to exorcise the intruder. In vain she
rubs her green rosary, muttering fervid prayers: the
spirit wails more loudly, more intolerably, and only
yields at last to the fiercer spells and rougher wrestling
of soul with soul on the part of a mountain-priest. But
his victory is short-lived, for a terrible phantom, the
Devil of Jealousy, wearing the famous Hanja mask,
replaces Rokujo. Inch by inch the priest falls back,
as the grinning demon with gilt horns and pointed
ears slowly unveiled from a shroudlike hood glides
forward to smite him with menacing crutch. To and
fro the battle rages beside the prostrate Aoi no Uye;
neither holy man nor devil will give way; the screaming
and shrill fifing of the musicians rise to frenzied
pitch; adjuration succeeds adjuration, until the evil
spirit is finally driven away. Nothing can exceed the
realism of this scene, so masterfully played that the
hardiest agnostic must be indeed fancy-proof if he
cannot feel something of the awe inspired into believers
by this terrific duel. Moreover, this is exactly the sort
of incident which exhibits to the full extent of their
potency the peculiar characteristics of <em>Nō</em> drama.
What human face, however disguised and distorted,
could rival the malignant horror of a Japanese mask?
What mincing and gibing Mephistopheles could compare
for a moment with the devilish ingenuity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
suspense of this posture-pantomime, with its endless
feints and threats and sallies and retreats? And how
the anguish of battle is enhanced by the “barbaric
yawp” and sharp, intermittent drum-taps, which excite
without distracting the spell-bound audience! So
abrupt and discreet is the interjected cry of the immobile
musicians that one might easily take it for the
defiant or hortative outburst of an invisible spirit
attracted to the ghostly combat. Indeed, all that is
wild and primitive in these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfants sauvages</i> of Melpomene
is chastened into harmony by the innate
sobriety of Japanese art. The creative instinct works
within small limits by small means, but with these
means it contrives to project on its tiny stage a vital
suggestion of the largest issues. The gods become
marionettes for an hour, without wholly losing their
godhead.</p>

<p>Good-humoured drollery, of which the gods come in
for a fair share, is no more alien to the Japanese than
it was to the Greek temperament. And if one had to
guess which divinity or divinities are regarded with
more affection than awe by such light-hearted worshippers,
one would certainly name the Rokujizō, or
six Jizō. While Buddha and Kwannon, Tenjin and
Inari, dwell in small or stately temples, augustly
apart, the six Jizō sit sociably in a row by the road-side
or on the outskirts of a shrine, protected (if
protected at all) from the weather by a plain wooden
shed. For they belong to the class of open-air minor
deities familiarly known as “wet gods.” Yet they
play a large part in the emotional life of the people.
Patrons of travellers, women, and children, they bear
the semblance of a shaven priest with benevolent
countenance, whose neck is generally encircled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
child’s bib of coloured wool, while his hand holds an
emblematic jewel, a lotus, a pilgrim’s staff, an incense-box,
a rosary, or sometimes an infant. In most
villages and near many schools will you find the six
Jizō, for the country people, loving their children,
cherish the children’s patron-saint with particular
attachment. The amusing <em>kiōgen</em> named “Rokujizō”
seemed to please the younger members of our audience
infinitely more than the romantic and spectral dramas
which preceded it. A pious farmer, anxious to attest
his gratitude for a good harvest, resolves to put up six
Jizō effigies in his fields, and, seeking a sculptor to
carry out his design, falls in with a knavish fellow who
boasts that he can carve statues more quickly than
any one else in the world, and promises that the six
shall be finished by the following day. The bargain
is concluded. Then the pseudo-sculptor persuades
three confederates to personate Jizō, entrusting them
with the jewel, the staff, and the other symbols. As
soon as they are well posed as living statuary, he
brings the farmer to admire them, and, pretending
that the other three are at the opposite end of the
field, sends the extemporised gods by a short cut to
anticipate the buyer’s arrival. He, however, though
duly impressed, desires to see the first three again,
and then again the second three, until the impersonators,
tired with running backwards and forwards,
forget what pose and what emblem to assume, entirely
destroying all illusion by their ridiculous perplexity.
The farmer discovers the trick, and administers a
sound drubbing to the fraudulent artist, while the Jizō
make their escape. The humour of this naturally
depends on the “business” of the performers, since no
pretence is made to literary merit in the dialogue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which is couched in colloquial Japanese of the same
period as the lyrical dramas themselves&mdash;that is, from
the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The most important, if not the most interesting, item
in the programme was a little historic play in two
scenes, entitled “Funa Benkei,” or “Benkei at Sea.”
No figure in Japanese annals is so popular as Benkei,
the devil youth (<em>Oniwaka</em>), credited with eight feet
of stature, unless it be Yoshitsune, the valiant boy,
who vanquished the giant in single combat on Gojō
Bridge in Kyōto, and thus acquired a loyal and invincible
henchman. The numberless adventures in
which Benkei by strength or cunning ensures the
success of Yoshitsune have been utilised again and
again by painters and playwrights. Unfortunately, the
fruits of victory are always snatched from Yoshitsune’s
grasp by the jealous despotism of his elder brother,
Yoritomo, the terrible chief of the Minamoto faction.
When the play opens he is discovered with a handful
of faithful followers at Omono-no-ura, whither he has
fled to escape the machinations of his brother; but
further progress is delayed by the arrival of Shizuka,
a beautiful geisha, who entreats permission to bid him
farewell. Benkei refuses to allow this, and asserts
that his master wishes her to return at once to Kamakura,
the capital, without an audience. But the girl
will not believe that her lover has sent so harsh a
message, and insists on dancing once more before
him. Shizuka’s dance is very elaborate and beautiful,
though a little tedious for the European, who has not
been trained to appreciate the symbolic import of
woven measure and waving arm. At the outset a
tall golden head-dress, in shape like an elongated
Phrygian cap, is carefully placed on her head. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
this she revolves and slowly, slowly expresses by that
choregraphic language&mdash;which the profane would take
years to acquire&mdash;all her passion and despair at losing
her lover and lord. Yoshitsune, deeply moved, gives
her a <em>saké</em> cup, as a sign that she may carouse with
him for the last time; but Benkei, sternly insensible
to dalliance, bids her withdraw and gives orders to
set sail.</p>

<p>Once more the performers take their places in a
primitive piece of framework representing a boat,
while the resources of orchestra and helmsman are
taxed to their utmost in the endeavour to simulate a
storm. The fife screams, the drums thunder, the
steersman stamps his foot, and suddenly out of the
furious tempest rise grim spectres with black, fleecy
hair, gilt horns, and blood-stained halberds. These
are the ghosts of the Taira clan, slaughtered by the
Minamoto in a great sea-fight at Dan-no-ura, two
years before&mdash;a battle which might be termed the
Bosworth Field of the great civil war which devastated
Japan in the latter half of the twelfth century.
Yoshitsune with youthful heat (he is always a boy in
the <em>Nō</em> dramas) lunges at the phantoms and shouts his
war-cry, but Benkei (who adds the functions of a priest
to his other accomplishments) strikes down his sword,
and, producing a rosary, hurls a volley of exorcising
prayers at the discomfited ghosts. As always, the play
ends in David’s deliverance from danger by the resourcefulness
of Goliath.</p>

<p>“Tsuchigumo,” the Earth-Spider, the last piece
performed, is founded on a curious legend, whose chief
merit may be that it affords excuse for a fantastic
stage-picture. It seems that a band of robbers, who
lived in caves and were known by the nickname of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
earth-spiders, were routed from their lairs and exterminated
by Kintaro, servant of Yoremitsu, whose
valour was much enhanced in popular estimation by
the flattering rumour that the defeated pests were not
men at all, but a race of enormous demon-insects.
Accordingly, the climax of “Tsuchigumo” is a stirring
encounter between Imperial Guards, armed with swords
and spears, and masked monsters, who entangle their
weapons and baffle their aim in a cloud of long gauzy
filaments, resembling the threads of a spider’s web.
The piece is pure pantomime, owing even less than
usual to music, incident, or poetic style. “The Owl-Priest,”
the last of the <em>kiōgen</em>, calls for no description.</p>

<p>Such are the religious plays in their last phase of
development, the fruit of a religious revival on the
part of archæologists and patriots. They are a curious
instance of wisely arrested growth. Had they never
passed the border-line of archaic dancing, their interpreters
would be a dwindling band of Shintō
priestesses to gaping peasants. Had they followed
in the track of popular drama, they might have been
expanded to those loosely-knit and blood-curdling
tableaux which delight the shopkeeper. But, being
compressed within severe limits and addressed to none
but educated audiences, they present in exquisite
epitome the literature, the history, the musical and
choregraphic art of mediæval Japan. The foreigner
derives from them an impression of the beliefs and
customs, the manners of speech and dress, the heroism
and the dignity, of feudal times. But to a native they
convey far more than this. “The <em>Nō</em> poetry,” writes
an enthusiast, “is like a great store of the treasures
of Eastern culture. It is full of allusions to the classical
stories of ‘Manyōshū’ and ‘Kokinshu,’ Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>poetry and Buddhist scriptures. Its chief characteristic
is colour. The words are gorgeous, splendid, and
even magnificent, as are the costumes.” But of their
literary value, and how far that value is enhanced or
impaired by flying puns and prismatic pillow-words,
I cannot judge. The Buddhist authorship is very
obvious in the case of “Aoi no Uye,” for it will be
noticed that, where the <em>miko</em>, or Shintō priestess,
failed to exorcise the Demon of Jealousy, the priest of
Buddha succeeded. But perhaps, in art of this kind,
so innocent of construction, so dependent on allusion,
it matters very little that the author should efface
himself behind the ideals advocated in his work. The
<em>Nō</em> are frankly didactic. Piety, reverence, martial
virtues are openly inculcated, though never in such
a way as to shock artistic sensibilities. Beauty and
taste go far to disguise all structural deficiencies.</p>

<p>But let us not apply to these the standard by which
we judge mature drama, demanding situation, character,
plot, movement. Rather compare them with the
miracle-plays and mysteries of the Chester or Coventry
collection, which hover between scriptural tableaux
and Gothic farce of a peculiarly gross kind. There is
no beauty in those rhymed versions of “The Descent
into Hell,” “Adam and Eve,” or “The Temptation in
the Wilderness.” The authors had such small sense of
decency and congruity, that after a serious attempt to
handle a solemn vision in “Pilate’s Wife’s Dream,” you
are confronted with this stage-direction: (“<em>Here shall
the Devil go to Pilate’s wife and draw the curtain, as
she lieth in bed, but she, soon after that he is come in,
shall make a rueful noise, running on the scaffold with
her skirt and her kirtle in her hand, and she shall
come before Pilate like a mad woman.</em>”) Imagine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
wildest of <em>kiōgen</em> incidents invading a <em>Nō</em>! How
shocked a Japanese audience would have been! If
the <em>Nō</em> seem occasionally <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> and puerile, the gross
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfantillage</i> of European miracle-plays none but
readers of them can believe. And, when we reach the
tedious “Moralities,” which coincided in this country
with the advent of the Protestant Tudors, and were
therefore written a century later than the best of the
<em>Nō</em>, the palm of sacred drama for beauty, interest,
and pathos must still be awarded to the disciples of
Buddha. Could anything less human or less dramatic
be imagined than a cast of personified abstractions,
bearing such names as Good Counsel, Knowledge,
Abominable Living, and God’s Merciful Promises?
We must console ourselves with the reflection that,
when once the stage had freed itself from ecclesiastical
fetters, the popular drama in England shot far ahead
of popular drama in Japan. No student of dramatic
art could think for a moment of bracketing Chikamatsu
with Shakespeare.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent">Between the sacred opera of Tōkyō and the comic
opera of London the difference is so stupendous, that
one shudders to reflect on the unfortunate fact that
English playgoers, until quite lately, derived most of
their ideas about Japan from “The Mikado” of
Mr. W. S. Gilbert and “The Geisha” of Mr. Owen
Hall. In 1885 so little was known about Japanese
customs and characteristics, that the Bab Balladist ran
no risk of insulting the intelligence of his auditors
when he introduced his puppets with the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“We are gentlemen of Japan,</p>
<p class="verse">Our attitude’s queer and quaint;</p>
<p class="verse">You’re wrong, if you think it ain’t.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">There was no one to tell him that his “gentlemen of
Japan” were not Japanese at all, but Chinamen without
pigtails. The very names&mdash;Pish-Tush, Nanki-Poo,
Pitti-Sing&mdash;were redolent of China, while Pooh-Bah,
with his insatiable appetite for bribes, was a
typical mandarin. However, the author had picked
up a real war-song, tune and all (“Miyasama,
miyasama”), and the Three Little Maids from School
giggled very prettily in their novel costumes. Subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
information throws a curious light on the
misleading characteristics of the Gilbert and Sullivan
opera, enabling me to acquit the producers of ignorance,
but not of mystification. I learn that the
Japanese representative accredited to the Court of
St. James’s very naturally objected to the slight implied
in attaching the name of his imperial master to
a frivolous and ridiculous extravaganza. One would
have thought that the most obvious obligations of
courtesy dictated a change of title and of rank in the
leading character. Instead, pains were taken to make
the action and demeanour of the performers so exaggerated
that no Japanese would recognise in them his
fellow-countrymen, while the British public, not being
in the secret, was encouraged to suppose the local
colour as correct as was compatible with the exigencies
of such a piece.</p>

<p>Eleven years later came “The Geisha.” By this
time Mr. Arthur Diosy had founded the Japan Society,
and gladly brought special knowledge to the help of
the management. The result was a very charming
and realistic picture, so far as externals were concerned.
The rickshaw-man and dapper policeman,
the wistaria and chrysanthemum, the frolicsome tea-house
girls, might have been imported from Yokohama.
This author, too, had picked up a real native song (“Jon
kina, jon kina”), of which the associations were fortunately
not explained to the audience. But the plot of
“The Geisha” was as farcically untrue to life as that of
“The Mikado.” And this time some one was found to
say so. An indignant Tōkyō journalist, who happened
to see the opera, thus commented on its import:</p>

<p>“The idea of Japan prevalent in foreign countries is
thus reflected:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Happy Japan,</p>
<p class="verse2">Garden of glitter!</p>
<p class="verse">Flower and fan,</p>
<p class="verse2">Flutter and flitter;</p>
<p class="verse">Lord of Bamboo,</p>
<p class="verse2">(Juvenile whacker!)</p>
<p class="verse">Porcelain too,</p>
<p class="verse2">Tea-tray and lacquer!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“Light-hearted friends of Japan find in these lines the
most happy features of the country, and overlook the
gross injustice done in the play to the Japanese nation.
A Japanese chief of police is made to proclaim publicly
that superior authority exists in order to satisfy the
personal desires of its holder. Human souls are sold
by public auction, and a person may be found guilty,
according to law, after trial or before! I would not
complain of these imputations, or rather results of
ignorance, creeping into a comic piece if it were not
patronised by those who think themselves good friends
of Japan, and if it were not illustrative of the way in
which they look at our country.”</p>

<p>At last, in September 1899, a serious romantic play,
purporting to represent Japanese life, was produced
under the title of “The Moonlight Blossom.” It was
even more faithfully staged than the comic operas.
We now saw for the first time a Shintō priest, a
blind shampooer, and a temple with wooden <em>torii</em> and
stone lanterns. The plot was compounded of Adelphi
elements, familiar enough, in spite of their flavouring
from Liberty’s. You had the good and bad brothers,
the misunderstood heroine, the intriguing widow,
forged documents, secret meetings, attempted murder.
You had even the “comic relief” and cockney humour
of a duel on stilts. But Adelphi incidents would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
have mattered so much (the Tōkyō drama is mostly
melodrama) if the author had avoided Adelphi psychology.
No Japanese woman indulges in the independence
or the invective of Naniwa. “What stupid
owls men are!” might pass for a maidenly jest in
this country; never in that. If Arumo were truly a
Nagasaki priest, he would never condescend to solicit
the advice and affection of the other sex. The fatal
substitution of Occidental for Oriental particulars in
“the way of a man with a maid” vitiated Mr. Fernald’s
claim to interpret Japanese romance. His men and
women lacked the dignity and severity of Eastern
etiquette.</p>

<p>In adapting “Madame Butterfly,” a popular American
story, for the Anglo-Saxon stage, Mr. David
Belasco was on far safer ground. Since M. Pierre
Loti set the fashion, many romancers have exploited
the pathos of temporary marriage between the faithless
Westerner and the trustful Oriental girl, but hitherto,
in spite of the obvious opportunities for scenic effect,
the theme had not been handled by a serious dramatist.
Now, Mr. Belasco relies greatly, as all who saw his
version of “Zaza” will remember, on the electrician
and the limelight man. To them belongs the credit of
the most exquisite and typical episode in “Madame
Butterfly.” As poor little O Chō San sat patiently at
her window, with her baby asleep beside her and her
face turned towards the harbour where lay the newly
arrived ship of her fickle lieutenant, for full twenty
minutes there was silence behind the footlights, while
through the paper panes of the <em>shōji</em> could be seen the
transition of dusk to darkness, of darkness to twilight,
of dawn to day. All the poetry of the play was in
those twenty minutes, and a great deal of its truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Devotion and dumb endurance are more characteristic,
I think, of such a woman than the melodramatic
suicide which touched so many of her audience to
tears. If a competent musician had co-operated with
the stage-manager to give us a play without words
in the manner of “L’Enfant Prodigue,” I should
have been better pleased, for the strange “broken
American” jargon and the silly monotonous song
which Miss Evelyn Millard had to say and sing,
though legitimate enough, were tiresomely out of harmony
with the grace and beauty of her movements,
her looks, her costume. An extraordinary lapse of
taste was that which permitted the dying heroine
to wave the star-spangled banner in her child’s
face. But most of all I doubt the verisimilitude of
the alleged motive for self-destruction. Sometimes
Madame Chrysanthème counts her money and feels
rather relieved when her foreign lover sails away;
sometimes she regrets him with genuine sorrow, and
might conceivably put an end to her life if confronted
with the alternative of an odious match. But what she
would not do is what Madame Butterfly does&mdash;namely,
consider that she had suffered a dishonour expiable
only by death. The Western sentiment of honour is
out of place in such a connection, for she had been
party with open eyes to a legal, extra-marital contract,
sanctioned by usage and arranged by her relations.
The infidelity of her partner might wound her heart;
it could not strike her conscience.</p>

<p>After many more or less accurate adumbrations of
Japanese life on the boards of London theatres, at last,
in the spring of 1900, came “The celebrated Japanese
Court Company from Tōkyō,” of which the leading
stars, Mr. Otojiro Kawakami and Madame Sada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Yacco, were freely described as the Henry Irving and
Ellen Terry of the Far East. Most of the critics,
expecting too much and understanding too little, went
empty away, or if they derived any pleasure from the
entertainment, derived it from purely æsthetic and
undramatic qualities. For a week the stars shone on
empty benches; but then the fashionable and artistic
public, which has a habit of ignoring the professional
critic, became aware of the fact that a miniature
comedy and tragedy of rare delicacy and charm, as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> as they were beautiful, could be seen, and seen
only for a few afternoons, in the prosaic neighbourhood
of Notting Hill. Success was assured, and we
are promised a return visit in the autumn. But the
critics were partly justified in their cold reception of
alien art. They had come for drama and been put off
with pantomime. “If this be Japanese drama,” they
said, “a little of it goes a long way. We have had
enough.” Had they been given drama as it is played
in Tōkyō, with long, irrelevant scenes and a plot
requiring four hours to unravel, how much more discontented
they would have been!</p>

<p>It is a pity that the advertising note was pitched
too high. Good wine needed less bush. There is
no “Japanese Court Company,” but his Majesty
the Emperor was once present at a performance by
Mr. Kawakami during a garden-party in the grounds
of the Marquis Kuroda. Mr. Kawakami is certainly
not the “Henry Irving of Japan,” for that title, whatever
be its precise meaning, belongs rather to Ichikawa
Danjuro, associated for more than half a century with
the impersonation of historical and mythical heroes.
But he holds a high and honourable position among
actors of the <em>sōshi</em> school, as they are called&mdash;a school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>which bears some resemblance to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Libre</span>
or the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre de l’Œuvre</span>. The <em>sōshi</em> were students,
desirous of reforming and modernising the conservative
traditions of their stage, and Mr. Kawakami’s contributions
to the movement consisted of two plays: a
realistic piece, founded on the war with China, which
brought him great profit and renown, and an adaptation
of “Round the World in Eighty Days.” As an actor
he is certainly free from the painful mannerisms of the
older generation: his elocution is more even, his action
more quiet and sudden, his facial expression less
exaggerated. As for Sada Yacco, who braved the
public opinion of her countrywomen by being the first
of her sex to act in company with masculine comrades,
her presence would be an acquisition to any stage.
Until three years ago she was a geisha, and thus
combines with much physical attraction of voice and
face the secret of supremely graceful movement. Her
dances were revelations of the witchery of Salome’s art.
Her histrionic powers are not less remarkable.</p>

<p>The pieces selected for representation were of course
wholly Japanese in subject and sentiment, but, being
greatly modified to suit the supposed infirmities of
foreign playgoers, they scarcely gave a correct impression
of the average Japanese play. To begin with,
that the sound of a strange language might not grow
wearisome, the dialogue was ruthlessly cut and curtailed;
next, as much dancing as possible was introduced,
so that the <em>damari</em>, or pantomimic scene, which
in Tōkyō is more or less of the nature of “comic
relief,” sandwiched between exciting incidents, almost
became the staple of the play. Finally, the co-incidental
music, which strikes so oddly on European
ears, was kept within wise limits. But, so far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
blaming Mr. Kawakami for these alterations, it is
evident that he erred on the right side, and that we
should thank him for lopping away several excrescences
which disfigure the drama of his native land.</p>

<p>“Zingoro, an Earnest Statue Carver,” narrates the
pretty legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, with the addition
of a jealous wife. Galatea is a famous geisha,
of whom Zingoro carves a statue and falls in love with
his own handiwork. The transformation from wood to
womanhood is familiar; one has seen it in “Niobe,” in
“La Poupée,” in “Pygmalion and Galatea,” but here it
is accomplished by a fanciful piece of satire. “Mirror
is the spirit of woman,” says the proverb, and the
sculptor has merely to slip a <em>kagami</em> into the bosom of
his feminine figure, whom vanity at once stirs to life.
Zingoro’s delighted astonishment and the doll’s awakening
consciousness are vividly portrayed, culminating
in a mimetic dance, in which Galatea copies all her
maker’s movements. But the climax is reached when
the jealous wife enters, and, seeking to reach her rival,
is arrested by the simultaneous animation of the God
of Thunder, the Carpenter, the Spearman, and the
Dwarf, who had up to that moment remained so
motionless that most of the audience believed them to
be lay-figures. I fancy none but Oriental actors could
have achieved this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de théâtre</i>, involving the strain
of prolonged muscular tension in attitudes of fantastic
violence.</p>

<p>Muscular feats were also prominent, too prominent,
in “Kojima Takanori” or “The Loyalist.” This
historical drama, which should have occupied three
hours, and was compressed into half-an-hour, is
founded on a famous instance of feudal loyalty. In
the beginning of the thirteenth century Yoshitoki, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
chief of the Hôjô family, acquired supreme power
under the title of Shikken (minister of the Shōgun or
commander-in-chief), and banished three emperors to
the little island of Oki. One of these, the Emperor
Godaigo, was passing through Inosha on his way to
exile, when Takanori, a faithful knight, learned of his
arrival, and, having adopted the disguise of a straw
rain-coat and hat, taken by force from two peasants,
hid himself in the royal garden. There, since even
his prodigious valour was unequal to the task of
rescuing his sovereign from Yoshitoki’s guards, he
resolved at least to furnish consolation by an act of
graceful chivalry. Planing the bark of a cherry-tree
with his sword, he painted on it with his writing-brush
the well-known words of an ancient poem, signifying
“While I live, you reign.” The soldiers of the
Shikken discovered and attacked him, but suffered an
inglorious repulse. Then, as a supreme reward, the
bamboo blind of the adjoining villa being lifted for a
moment, the Mikado smiled gratefully on his brave
adherent, who, touched to the heart, succumbed to
happy tears.</p>

<p>This poetic and passionate loyalty, so strangely
transported to Notting Hill, was admirably embodied
by Mr. Kawakami. Alternately fierce and pensive,
agile and immobile, he played the part of Takanori
with such force and feeling, that <em>yamato-damashii</em>, the
fervent temper of Japanese chivalry, lived and moved
before us, a visibly realised ideal. I fear, however,
that for most of us the serious side of the play was
marred by terrific, perpetual fighting. It cannot be
doubted that, in days when bows and arrows, swords
and spears, were the only weapons, men were capable
of extraordinary, acrobatic, hand-to-hand encounters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
An American critic, who studied this feature of the
acting from the point of view of a professional pugilist,
was astounded by the number of throws, lifts, and
twists employed, in addition to those tricks peculiar
to <em>jūjutsu</em>, which other races have yet to learn. But
the clash of sparkling swords and the thud of falling
bodies were so incessant, that one was apt to lose
sight of the ferocious realism, and notice only the
comic surprises of this partly historical, partly conventional
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>. To one irreverent lady it suggested
the idea of furious grasshoppers battling on the slopes
of Fuji.</p>

<p>The last play, written by Mr. Kawakami himself
about ten years ago&mdash;“The Geisha and the Knight”&mdash;is
dramatically the best as well as the most picturesque.
It furnishes Madame Sada Yacco with a
part which affords full scope for her talents. It
proves her not only an ethereal dancer, but a tragic
actress of real power. When the curtain rises we are
in the Yoshiwara of Yedo (euphemistically termed the
geisha-quarter), with its line of cherry-trees in full
blossom between the fifty tea-houses, with the bustling
crowd of domestics, minstrels, dancing-girls, and
<em>samurai</em>, conventionally disguised, as a knight was
bound to be, by <em>amigasa</em>, or large braided hats.
Katsuragi, the famous courtesan, attended by her
little bevy of servants, passes in gorgeous apparel on
those high, black-lacquered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots</i> which only the <em>taiyu</em>
might wear. Soon a quarrel bursts out between
her rival suitors, and Banza, determined to provoke
a duel, inflicts on Nagoya the disgraceful insult of
<em>sayâte</em>, a blow on the sword from a sword’s hilt. But
scarcely has the fight begun when the girl throws
herself between and compels her lover to desist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The second act passes in a Buddhist temple, where
Nagoya, flying with his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>, Orikime, from the
jealous and abandoned beauty, has taken refuge. But
Katsuragi, well knowing that no woman may enter
there alone, yet tries to cajole the genial priests by
the pretence of dancing in honour of Buddha. Permission
is given. First she treads a solemn temple-dance,
a <em>no-mai</em>, wearing the golden mitre of a mediæval
geisha; then, as the jocular monks relent and even
mimic her, she performs dance after dance. A child,
she trips through the ball-dance (<em>maru-odori</em>), chasing
and tossing an imaginary ball with nimble gaiety; a
woman, she personates the cherry-blossom, and,
crowned with a floral emblem, while red flames of
flowers unroll from her hands, she stoops and sways
like a bough in May; a priestess of Inari, the rice-goddess,
with upturned hands and conical drum she
depicts the terror of the goblin-fox in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas de
fascination</i> woven of strange swift rushes and sudden
turns. But all her wiles are useless. The monks
roughly repulse her when she attempts to enter the
temple itself. But Katsuragi is not to be baulked.
Suddenly she flies through the gate and as suddenly
reappears, driving before her the hapless Orikime,
whom she batters down with the huge striker of the
temple-bell. At this moment, with bare arms and
dishevelled hair, she thrills and dominates the audience:
the fairy has become a fury; the comedy is at once
attuned by this tragic figure to ghastly seriousness. A
priest aims a blow at her, but Nagoya arrives in time
to ward it off, and, panting, frenzied by conflicting
passions, she sinks dying in her lover’s arms.</p>

<p>A fourth play was subsequently added, which I had
not the good fortune to see; but from the foregoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
descriptions it will be evident that Mr. Kawakami
brought us, if not entire plays, at any rate authentic
glimpses of the unfamiliar world in which Japanese
playgoers delight. It is an ingenious, palpitating
world, richly stored with action and sentiment and lit
with many cross-lights of allusive fancy. There is so
much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> and childish joy in it, so many pretty and
grotesque details, that one easily is diverted by these
from the consideration of its deeper aspects. Both
are better comprehended by a retrospective glance at
theatrical history.</p>

<p>It is rather interesting to observe that national
drama began its career in England and Japan at
about the same time. In 1575 Okuni, the pretty
priestess who ran away from the Kizuki temple in
Izumo with Nagoya Sanzaburō, and made her peace
with the god Ōnamuji by devoting part of the receipts
to repairing his shrine, gave her first theatrical performance
at Kyōto. In 1576 “the Earl of Leicester’s
servants” erected the first public theatre in Blackfriars.
The times were dramatic, and the excitement of foreign
adventure quickened the impulse of the masses towards
a more turbulent form of art than religious plays. The
Spanish Armada was defeated in 1588, and in 1592
Hideyoshi’s armada set sail for the conquest of Corea.
The dramatists were men of similar stamp. Just as
Greene and Marlowe were reckless rebels against
tradition and convention, so Chikamatsu was a <em>rōnin</em>,
or disgraced <em>samurai</em>, too headstrong to endure feudal
discipline. Small wonder, then, that their plays were
full of “coarse horrors and vulgar blood-shedding.”
Independence of Christian “Mysteries” and Buddhist
<em>Nō</em> was a marked characteristic of the secular
humanistic drama, but whereas England had not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to wait for a Shakespeare, the fifty odd five-act pieces
of Chikamatsu were written between 1690 and 1724.</p>

<p>Moreover, they were written for marionettes. This
fact explains many surviving customs, which hamper
theatrical representation to the present day. Although
the thread of poetical narrative, on which spectacular
episodes were strung, is much attenuated, the chorus,
charged with reciting it to musical accompaniment, is
not yet banished from a cage or stage-box behind the
footlights to the right of the audience. Many actors
retain the stiff, jerky motions of the wire-pulled dolls
which they were formerly taught to imitate, and
whereas the words through artificial declamation are
often difficult to follow, more persistent appeal is made
to the eye than the ear by pose and gesture. Why
the dramatist should have preferred wooden to human
puppets is hard to say, unless it be that they were
capable of more amazing contortions, for acrobatic
activity plays a large part in legitimate drama, which
would seem incomplete without <em>damari</em>, or pantomimic
scenes.</p>

<p>Chikamatsu was followed by Takeda Izumo, who
reduced the function of the chorus, and thus lessened
the opportunity for literary display. In both writers
you find sensational plots, surcharged with incident
and developed in daring disregard of probability.
While the marionettes’ theatre at Ōsaka was thus
served, the men’s theatre at Yedo was provided with
pieces of a similar character with regard to substance,
though the style was colloquial and the dialogue largely
invented by the actors. Since the eighteenth century
it may be said without injustice that the <em>kabuki-shibai</em>
(popular theatre) has remained stationary. Certain
improvements in histrionic and scenic matters have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
been introduced, but no development in construction
and character-drawing, as we understand those terms,
no change in the peculiar ethical and feudal teachings
of the Yedo period, has supervened. Enter a Tōkyō
theatre to-day, and you will find yourself in old Japan,
among resplendent monsters, whose actions violate our
moral sense, yet exhibit a high and stern morality by
no means out-moded through the advent of modern
ideas.</p>

<p>Beauty and duty are the hall-marks that stamp as
authentic the plays which delight and instruct the
Japanese. A race of artists, they expect and obtain
such stage-pictures as no other stage affords. To
watch act after act of their spectacular tragedies is
like looking through a portfolio of their best colour-prints.
One revels in the rich series of glowing hues,
flowing lines, majestic contours. And, whereas in a
play by Shakespeare or Molière, however sumptuously
mounted, the European actor often spoils the picture
by inability to wear the garb and adopt the gait of
more ceremonious ages, becoming a vociferous fashion-plate,
a strenuous caricature, the Oriental actor never
does so. He has not been forced to acquire, having
never lost, the dignified movements proper to more
deliberate dress. His pictorial charm is enhanced by
his faculty of sublime repose. Fidgety “supers” are
unknown. Moreover, visible beauty, of which the
credit may be shared between costumier and stage-manager,
is supplemented by the invisible beauty of
ideas. The author can give free rein to fancy. Dragons
and demons, ogres and magicians, will not be wasted
on prosaic pittites, who starve their imagination by
feeding it once a year on vulgarised pantomime,
because to them music-hall ditties are more congenial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
than a midsummer-night’s dream. His audience would
just as soon hear a fairy-story as a love-story. When
“The Tongue-cut Sparrow” or “The Fisher-Boy of
Urashima” is presented, the adults are quite as appreciative
as the children. Perhaps this imaginative
audience is too complaisant. It ignores the cloaked
attendants, who creep about the stage to remove
“properties” or in other ways assist the actors, because
it knows that their black garments denote invisibility
and is much too polite to perceive them. The same
readiness to meet illusion half-way is shown by the
retention of the <em>hana-michi</em> or flower-walks, two
inclined platforms which slope from the stage to the
back of the auditorium, trisecting the pit and enabling
the actors to make their entry or exit through the
midst of the spectators. On the other hand, they
facilitate the execution of processional and recessional
effects.</p>

<p>After all, the aim of Eastern art is not illusion, but
edification. However clear the call of beauty, duty’s
voice is louder still&mdash;duty, not as we Westerns conceive
it, a half-hearted compromise between our own interests
and those of others, but complete moral and mental
suicide. No lesson was more impressively preached to
the people by the dramatists in hundreds of historical
plays than the duty of obedience at any price. Iyeyasu
had established a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax japonica</i>, a golden age, in which
there was no war, but a rigid system of caste upon
caste: obedience was the cement which held the whole
together. The cultivated <em>samurai</em> were not allowed to
enter the theatre, but the masses were melted to tears
and heated to transports of patriotic subservience by
the representation of heroic self-sacrifice. As a political
instrument the Greek Church is not more useful to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Czar for indoctrinating docile peasants than the Yedo
drama was of service to the Shōgun.</p>

<p>One of the most admired examples of unscrupulous
virtue is Nakamitsu, applauded in 1898 as in 1598, for
the same hero holds the stage for centuries. This is
the story of Nakamitsu. His feudal lord, Manju, had
confided a reprobate son, named Bijomaru, to his care,
in the hope that a <em>samurai’s</em> control would prove more
efficacious than a priest’s; but, as Bijomaru continued
to “indulge in all sorts of wild sports, sometimes
going so far as to kill innocent common people,”
Nakamitsu was ordered to put him to death. Instead
of doing so, he beheaded his own son, Kojumaru, and
took the head to his master, who, believing in his
fidelity, refused to inspect it. Years afterwards, when
Bijomaru has become an irreproachable priest, he is
restored to his father, who forgives Nakamitsu for disobeying
him and rewards his self-sacrifice with the
gift of an adopted son and an extensive tract of land.
Now, the moral of this story to us appears atrocious,
that a father may murder his son to oblige his
general, but a little reflection will show that the Jewish
legend of the interrupted sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham,
though similar, is less heroic. For Nakamitsu’s act
was voluntary, and his son, eager to be sacrificed on
the altar of duty, welcomed death, while Manju had not
demanded such cruel fidelity.</p>

<p>A typical instance of the teaching and technique of
popular plays is furnished by “Ichi-no-tani Futaba-gunki”
(“The Tale of the Sapling of Ichi-no-tani”),
produced with exceptional splendour and a first-rate
cast&mdash;both Danjuro and Kikugoro, leading Japanese
actors, were included&mdash;at the chief Tōkyō theatre in
the autumn of 1898. The incident, more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
historical, on which it is founded, is simple enough.
During the great civil war between the Taira and
Minamoto clans in the twelfth century, a Minamoto
general, Kumagaya, is said to have been so touched by
the likeness to his own son of a youthful adversary,
named Atsumori, that he spared his life and connived
at his escape from the battle of Ichi-no-tani, a famous
valley near Kōbe. This theme had to be embroidered
with improbable episodes and extravagant actions to
satisfy public taste. Accordingly, Kumagaya saves
Atsumori’s life in a supremely sensational manner. In
obedience to secret orders from his feudal lord,
Yoshitsune, he induces his son Kojiro to enter
Atsumori’s castle by cutting down a score of guards
single-handed, to change clothes with Atsumori, to
personate Atsumori so as to deceive both friend and
foe, and finally to be killed by his own father in single
combat, that the world may be absolutely convinced of
Atsumori’s death. While the plot requires that most
of the characters in the piece should be mystified, it is
important that the audience should not be mystified,
and this twofold object is secured by the ingenious co-operation
of stage and cage. While father and son,
mounted on terrific black and white chargers, interchange
threats and insults so as to blind their fellow-actors,
the chorus expresses their real feelings of
anguish and affection in such pathetic strains that the
audience cannot fail to grasp the situation. But concealment
of the truth from the other characters leads
to more entanglements. Atsumori’s mother, the Lady
Wistaria, believing her son to be dead, pays a visit to
the murderer’s wife, and discovering in her a feudal
dependent, insinuates that her obvious duty is to assist
in her husband’s assassination when he shall return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
When Kumagaya comes home, his position, between
the woman who thinks he has killed her son and the
woman whose son he has really killed, is made more
embarrassing by the fact that Kajiwara, an enemy who
suspects the truth, is listening at the door. His fluent
and inconsistent explanations would be superfluous if
he might show the dead man’s head, which he carries
with him in a box; but that must, of course, only be
revealed at the last moment to Yoshitsune as a proof
of his loyal obedience, when he will be praised for his
loyal devotion and retire to a Buddhist monastery,
muttering “Life is a hollow dream.” The piece is
a great deal more complicated than might be supposed
from the foregoing analysis. Subsidiary peasants,
beggars, and woodcutters turn out at opportune
moments to be Taira or Minamoto warriors and court-ladies
in disguise. The first three acts are occupied
with a kind of prologue, which has only two points of
contact with the main Atsumori <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">motif</i>: first, the characters,
though entirely different, belong to the same
historic period; and, secondly, their business is also to
glorify parental murder.</p>

<p>Casuists have urged that to sacrifice another’s life,
even though that other be one’s own child, is less
heroic than to sacrifice oneself. But that, too, is
common in the <em>jidaimono</em>, or historical plays, which
far outnumber the rest in popularity. Not to speak of
the forty-seven <em>rōnin</em>, whose simultaneous suicide is
the subject of more than fifty dramas, and whose venerated
tombs at Sengakuji are yet covered with poems
and visiting-cards every New Year’s Day, I suppose
one drama in ten contains a case of <em>hara-kiri</em>, or
“happy dispatch.” The actor writes a letter, generally
in blood, to explain why his honour requires self-slaughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and then with great deliberation draws a
knife across his stomach, until his admirably twitching
limbs are covered with gore. At this point the
squeamish foreigner is apt to leave the theatre, but
the Japanese babies do not blench at blood, and are
taught by such sights from their earliest years that
superb indifference to death, that supreme attachment
to honour, which no other nation displays to the same
degree. <em>Hara-kiri</em> cannot be approved by utilitarians,
but it implies a higher pitch of heroism than you find
in a British melodrama, where the hero and villain are
probably engaged in selfish rivalry for the hand of the
same young woman, and merely differ in the choice of
means to gratify the same desire. I find an exquisite
instance of Japanese subtlety in the mingled ferocity
and devotion of their popular plays, which please at
once the devil and the angel cohabiting the human
heart. If the devil gloat over blood-shedding, the
angel exults in death for an ideal. The devil holds
the knife and the angel rams it in. Nor must you
suppose that the playgoers who revel in such incidents
regard them as part and parcel of an effete morality.
Every few years the partisans of Western ethics are
startled by similar tragedies. The assassins or would-be
assassins of Viscount Mori in 1887, of Count Okuma
in 1889, of the Czarevitch in 1891, of Li Hung Chang
in 1895, were prepared to pay with their own lives
for what they deemed dishonourable concessions to
foreigners. The young girl, Yuko Hatakeyama, who
cut her throat in expiation of the outrage offered to the
Czarevitch; the young wife of Lieutenant Asada, who,
learning of his death on the battlefield, slew herself
before his portrait, that she might follow him; the forty
soldiers, who took their own lives because the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
gave up Liaotung at the bidding of Russia,
France, and Germany&mdash;all these were as widely
praised and honoured by their fellow-countrymen as
Kumagaya or Nakamitsu.</p>

<p>Next in popularity to the historical are the social
plays (<em>sewamono</em>), of which the main topic is love.
This love, however, has nothing in common with the
well-regulated affections which dominate our middle-class
comedy from “Our Boys” to “Sweet Lavender,”
and culminate in the addition of two or three conventional
couples to suburban villadom. Domestic happiness
having been arranged for most young folk by their
elders, neither courtship nor marriage (if the former
could be said to exist) presented material for dramatic
treatment. The heroine is either a geisha or a
courtesan, exposed by her profession to the worst
caprice of passion and of fortune. In neither case is
she necessarily repulsive or even reprehensible. On
the contrary, she is often held up to sympathy as a
model of filial devotion, having sold her virtue for a
certain period to save her parents from beggary.
Public opinion is still so much more Confucian than
Christian among Japanese peasants, that not only does
a father incur no odium for selling his daughter, but
she would be regarded in many districts as wickedly
unfilial if she objected to be sold. It is true that by
decrees added to Japanese law in 1875 and 1896 such
sale is forbidden: girls are no longer bought; they
are hired. But during the Yedo period, whose morals
are mostly reflected in such pieces, the famous <em>oiran
sama</em> or lady-courtesan was a very dazzling figure,
while the humble <em>jōro</em> was at least regarded with pity.
If we put aside for the moment Western feeling on
this subject, it is clear that no romance could be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
deeply pathetic than that of a duteous heart fluttering
behind the gilded bars of self-imposed shame and
responding to the generous affection of a liberating
lover. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</i> of spies and gaolers made
escape no easy thing: thus plenty of dangerous adventure
would diversify the plot. The nimble-witted
theatre-goer loves intrigue, and follows hero and
heroine through an imbroglio of ruses and disguises
and machinations which it would be tedious to describe.
Again let me pay tribute to the ingenuity of the didactic
dramatist, who illustrates a lesson in filial unselfishness
with pictures of attractive wickedness. Few scenes
could surpass in beauty the luxurious lupanar, with its
troop of richly robed Delilahs. Drury Lane has produced
nothing more spectacular or more sensational
than the meretricious, murderous dramas of this class.</p>

<p>Less numerous, but of great interest to the student,
are <em>Oikemono</em>, or plays “connected with the private
troubles of some illustrious family.” These would
obviously strengthen feudal ties, and some have considerable
merit. The first piece I saw in a Japanese
theatre was founded on the legend (told at length in
Mr. Mitford’s “Tales of Old Japan”) of the Nabeshima
cat. One of the lords of Nabeshima had the
misfortune to marry a species of vampire-cat, or rather
his wife was possessed by one. While the daimyō and
his friends keep watch, the wife retires to bed, and
soon the shadow of a cat’s head is silhouetted on the
paper lantern near her couch. Caterwauling is heard:
the watchers, armed with swords, rush in and stab the
cat-wife, whose death ends the play. Life in the court
of a feudal lord during the Tokugawa shogunate is
most vividly portrayed in “Kagamiyama-kokyo-no-nishiki,”
which may be regarded as the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
counterpart of Scribe’s “Bataille de Femmes,” except
that the ruling passion is not love, but loyalty. It
deals with a feud between two court ladies. Iwafugi,
old and ugly, is jealous of the favour extended to
Onoye by the daimyō’s daughter, who has entrusted
to her care a consecrated statue of Buddha and a box
of precious perfume. Having caused these to be
stolen and concealed with a straw-sandal of her own,
Iwafugi accuses her young rival of trying to fasten
the theft upon her, strikes her in the face with the
sandal, and leaves the mortified Onoye no remedy
for insult but suicide. But Ohatsu, a devoted maid
of the latter, avenges her mistress by stabbing Iwafugi
to death, and is rewarded with promotion to high rank.
Thus the supreme merit of loyalty at any cost is once
more vindicated. This piece is interesting, because it
furnishes the veteran actor, Danjuro, with a striking
female part&mdash;that of Iwafugi&mdash;and proves that the
subjection of women in domestic matters by no means
robbed them of spirit and individuality. The rash
inference that Confucian domesticity must reduce
women to the level of a slave or a doll is disproved
by the heroic figures which are so frequent in historical,
social, and court-family drama.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the popular play, dear to both actors
and public, who value Western imports of a material
kind, but prefer their own moral and social ideals to
those of foreigners. Railways and ironclads may be
readily adopted, but not the New Testament or the
New Woman. Yet, setting such vexed questions
aside, and taking the neutral ground of art, it is clear
that the pieces which I have described are inferior
even to the archaic <em>Nō</em>. Let them be as imaginative,
as patriotic, as lofty as you like, they remain stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
spectacles, without cohesion, depth, or unity. They
are fascinating pictures of a deeply loved and daily
vanishing past, but drama of a high sort they are not.
Is there no movement, it will be asked, among the
more educated classes to raise the standard of art,
to create a drama which shall appeal less to the eye
and more to the intelligence?</p>

<p>Yes; there are two forces at work which deserve
credit for their energy in what is almost an impossible
task until the conditions of theatrical representation
shall be radically altered. How is the action
to be compressed within reasonable limits when the
audience demand a whole day’s entertainment? How
is closer realism to be achieved by the actor when the
never silent orchestra compels him to pitch his voice
in a falsetto key? How are women’s parts to be adequately
rendered so long as men monopolise the stage?
How are women to take their places when the size of
the theatre and the length of the performance put a
prohibitive strain on their physical powers? And how
is the author to complete a masterpiece when manager,
actor, and musician claim the right to interpolate
scenes, business, and melody for the irrelevant amusement
of the uncritical? These questions must be
answered before reform can make headway. In the
meantime, a glance at what reformers have tried to
accomplish is only due to their laudable endeavour.</p>

<p>Rather more than ten years ago, when enthusiasm
for Western things was at its height, a species of
independent theatre, calling itself the Sōshi-Shibai,
was started with a loud flourish of trumpets in Tōkyō.
The promoters were <em>sōshi</em> (ex-students), who, as
actors or authors, or both, proclaimed their intention
of revolutionising the stage and informing it with nineteenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
culture. They began, as such societies
generally begin, with translations, and by dramatising
the romances of the elder Dumas succeeded for a
time in attracting. “The Three Musketeers” and
“Monte Cristo” were spectacular enough to please.
But when it came to producing original work, their
will was found to exceed their capacity. Without
enough money or experience to make a sustained
effort, they kindled a flame which soon flickered out.
Mr. Kawakami, as I have already stated, won a great
success by dramatising the more striking incidents of
the war with China. He visited Port Arthur and
supplied himself with photographs of many varieties,
so that, at any rate, his play was realistically mounted.
How far its structure was in advance of less up-to-date
pieces I cannot say. If it at all resembled his
adaptation of “Round the World in Eighty Days,” I
fear it was no more than a series of tableaux. But no
production on strictly European lines could command
an intelligent, much less a sympathetic, reception from
playgoers unacquainted with European life. In the
summer of 1898 Mr. Osada, whose models are Parisian,
presented his compatriots with a version of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
monde où l’on s’ennuie.</span>” It will be remembered that
the climax of that amusing comedy is reached when a
young diplomat is discovered kissing his wife in a
dark conservatory by the scandalised guests, at a
French château. Now, the Tōkyō tradesman has
never kissed anybody, and would not incommode his
wife with sentimental attention. He was merely mystified
by this queer illustration of barbarian habit, and
returned with relief to the contemplation of his politely
blood-stained ancestors.</p>

<p>The most promising path of improvement would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
seem to be that pursued by Mr. Tsuboüchi and
Mr. Fukuchi, who continue to write plays on episodes
in their own history, but strive to avoid the extravagance
and unreality of their predecessors. Mr.
Tsuboüchi, who was well known as a critic and novelist
before he turned playwright, invented the term <em>mugen-gekki</em>
or “dream-play” in ridicule of such wildly
improbable incidents as disfigure “The Tale of the
Sapling of Ichi-no-tani.” I have not seen his own
drama, the “Maki no Kati” (1897), which deals with
the turbulent thirteenth century, but Mr. Aston
discerns in it “careful workmanship and gratifying
freedom from extravagance,” in spite of “several
murders and two <em>hara-kiri</em> by women.” Of Mr.
Fukuchi’s work I can write with some confidence,
having been privileged on many occasions to discuss it
with him. He is recognised as the leading Japanese
playwright, and has produced about thirty plays during
the last ten years. He has been engaged for some
time on translations of “Hamlet” and “Othello,” but
has no idea of staging them, for reasons which will be
presently explained. Though anxious to modernise
the drama by introducing less bloodshed and more
careful study of character, he finds modern Japan
unsuited to dramatic treatment. The typical advocate
of progress, who dresses and talks like a foreigner,
takes little interest in his own arts and antiquities,
being absorbed in politics or money-making. He has
neither the picturesque nor heroic qualities which a
dramatist postulates, and is therefore rejected by
Mr. Fukuchi in his search for material. A serious
obstacle to reform lies in the ignorance of actors and
the indifference of the upper classes. While the
former too often lack the erudition to appreciate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
interpret a scholarly reproduction of antique habit and
speech, the latter are only beginning to discard their
aristocratic prejudice against the theatre, compelling
the author to write down to the level of his middle and
lower class audience. But better education and more
democratic ideals are beginning to tell. The reception
of “Kasuga-no-Tsubone” (“The Lady-in-Waiting of
Kasuga”)&mdash;one of Mr. Fukuchi’s finest plays&mdash;marked
a most creditable advance in public judgment.</p>

<p>Here was a piece entirely devoid of sensational
incident, depending on neither love nor death nor
abnormal sacrifice for its appeal, but narrating the
discharge of public duty by a high-spirited woman
in the face of ceaseless intrigue and danger. It brings
out the noblest side of Japanese statesmanship, the far-seeing
wisdom and patience of the ruler, together with
the perseverance and devotion of the ruled. The political
and personal strands of interest are so cleverly combined,
that for once the grey fabric of governmental
policy is sufficiently embroidered with a pattern in gold
of intersecting character: the scarlet thread is scarcely
missed. Briefly this is the tale. Iyeyasu, having completed
his work of equipping Japan with a durable
constitution, retired to Suruga, and, leaving the shōgunate
in Hidetada’s hands, continued to take private
measures for the future welfare of the State. One of
these was the education of his grandson, Taketiyo
(better known as Iyemitsu), whom he wished to be
trained in the severest school of military discipline.
For this purpose he chose the Lady of Kasuga, whose
husband, Inaba Sado-no-Kami, was a <em>rōnin</em>, having
been dispossessed of title and estates by Hideyoshi.
The task was beset with difficulty. First the wife
of Hidetada, and then that Shōgun himself, lost no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
occasion of thwarting her efforts and of putting forward
Kunityo, a younger prince, whose gentler and more
refined manner gained him many partisans at Court.
In despair of winning her cause, the Lady of Kasuga
fled to Suruga in the garb of a pilgrim and begged
Iyeyasu to decide between the rival candidates. The
old man thereupon returned to Yedo and subjected
the brothers to searching tests of both intellectual and
physical capacity. In all these the more Spartan pupil
of the <em>samurai’s</em> wife proved victorious. Up to this
point the plot does not differ very materially from
ordinary histories of disputed succession, but the last
act is peculiarly illustrative of woman’s status during
the Tokugawa <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>. Asked to choose her own
reward for service so admirably rendered, the preceptress
of Iyemitsu solicits the restoration to her
husband of his rank and estates; but he, regarding
such a proposal as wounding to his honour, proceeds to
divorce her. Iyeyasu then offers to make the wife a
daimyō, but she refuses, on the ground that to accept
would be to still further dishonour her husband.
In the end Inaba is reinstated for having exhibited a
proper spirit of pride and independence, while the
Lady of Kasuga resumes her place at his side.</p>

<p>On the lines of this play, in which conflict of
scheming interests is substituted for hand-to-hand
fighting, while a clearly developed story replaces the
old <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla podrida</i> of loosely connected scenes, there is
great hope of raising popular drama from a somewhat
crude condition to the level of serious art. It has
never aimed at merely amusing the populace; it has
always professed to instruct them. In the hands of
Mr. Fukuchi and men of his stamp its patriotic bias
need not be weakened, while its artistic worth will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
much increased. But it is by no means likely that
European drama will affect its substance, however
largely it may influence the form. On this point
Mr. Fukuchi is as emphatic as Mr. Danjuro. Shakespeare
is impossible. His teaching would be at least
as pernicious in its effect on feminine morals and the
structure of society as that of Ibsen is considered by
conservative moralists in this country. We have seen
that the restriction of woman’s sphere to loving and
serving does not necessarily rob her of courage or
resolution. Many foreigners resident in Japan have
not hesitated to declare their conviction that the
“childish, confiding, sweet Japanese girl” is superior
to the “calculating, penetrating, diamond-hard American
woman,” the consequence and nemesis of masculine
idolatry. A little reflection will show how shocking
the heroines of Shakespeare must seem to admirers
of the former type. You have Rosalind, swaggering
shamelessly in male attire; Beatrice, cutting such
coarse quips as Benedick himself would scarcely venture
upon to-day in a London club; Portia, masquerading
in cap and gown, and exposing her lover to
dishonour by snatching his betrothal-ring; Juliet and
Jessica, selfishly disregardful of their parents’ wishes;
and Katherine the shrew, whose violent vulgarity
fortunately could not be translated into so polite a
language as Japanese. As for “The Merry Wives
of Windsor,” should the Sōshi-Shibai ever dare to
present it, I feel sure that the Tōkyō counterpart of
Mr. Clement Scott would denounce their action in
such terms as these:</p>

<p>“This disgusting representation of the most loathsome
of all Shakespeare’s plays was unutterably offensive.
So foul a concoction ought never to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
allowed to disgrace the boards of a Japanese theatre.
The lewd maunderings of Sir John Falstaff, the licentious
jesting of Mistress Ford, Mistress Page, and Mistress
Quickly must excite reprobation in all but those
lovers of prurience and dabblers in impropriety who are
eager to gratify their illicit tastes under the pretence
of art. Ninety-seven per cent. of the people who
laughed to see the fat knight smothered in a basket of
dirty linen are nasty-minded people. Outside a silly
clique there is not the slightest interest in the Elizabethan
humbug or all his works.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent">Many foreigners, unable to catch the meaning of what
is to them a rather tedious dumb-show, pay short and
perfunctory visits to the theatre. But this is not wise,
for, even should the play lie outside their comprehension,
the native playgoers are both affable to accost
and interesting to study. They are seated in lidless
boxes lined with matting, in parties of four and five,
on the ground, on slightly elevated seats at the side,
or in a long gallery surrounding the house. A box in
the first position will cost about eight shillings, in the
second about nine, in the last eleven. The higher you
climb the more you pay, except in the <em>Oikomi</em> (“driven-in-place”),
where the “gods” are crowded together in
a grated pen, from which little can be seen or heard;
but then the price is no more than sixpence, or a
penny an act if they cannot afford to witness the
whole performance. This will consist of two long
plays lasting about four hours each, with an intermediary
tableau, which is generally the most beautifully
mounted of all. During the day every one eats
and drinks and smokes. The women take tea, the
men <em>saké</em>, while the babies loudly and numerously
imbibe milk. Between the acts, when the handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
curtains (often gifts from admiring associations to a
popular artist) descend, the audience strolls about the
<em>undoba</em>, a large enclosure surrounding the theatre, in
which the stall-keepers sell refreshments, photographs,
toys, and all kinds of ornamental knick-knacks. You
escape the headache engendered by the gas and close
atmosphere of a Western play-house, for the sliding
shutters that form the outer walls of the upper storey
can be opened at will to admit currents of cool air.
The best day to go is Monday, for that is the pay-day
of the geisha, whom you will see in almost as many
costumes as the actor, since she loves to return to
an adjacent tea-house at frequent intervals for the
purpose of renewing her charms of apparel and complexion.</p>

<p>Tea-houses surround a theatre as jackals a lion;
their co-operation is indispensable to the success of an
indoor picnic. Besides, it is not considered genteel to
apply for seats at the door. Your only chance of a
good place is to secure the kind offices of a tea-house
proprietor, who will provide attendance and refreshments,
besides taking charge of your watch, purse, and
any other article of value. The Tōkyō pickpocket
is very adroit, and a constant patron of dramatic
art. Formerly the entertainment began at dawn, but
the Government, which exercises paternal supervision
over popular amusements, has now limited its length
to eight or nine hours, so that, if you arrive at half-past
ten, you may be sure of seeing the programme
played out until seven or eight in the evening.
Having left your shoes at the tea-house in exchange
for a wooden check and sandals, you will be conducted
to a box and presented by a polite attendant
with cushion, programme, tobacco-box, tea, and sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
cakes, with luncheon to follow. Now, at last, you are
at liberty to observe the antics of the actors.</p>

<p>As you cannot understand what they say, you notice
more particularly how they say it. At first their
elocution will seem both painful and artificial: the
tones are too shrill or too gruff, equally removed from
the diapason of natural speech. But that is because
the traditional <em>samisen</em>, a three-stringed guitar, follows
the performer like a curse from start to finish. Unless
he pitched his voice above or below its notes, he could
not be heard. Even so, the author complains that his
words receive inadequate attention from either player
or playgoer, for the former relies chiefly on pose and
facial expression to score his points, while the latter
obediently admires the methods of acting to which he
has always been accustomed. It cannot be denied
that these methods are effective. I have seen the
feminine part of the audience infected with such violent
emotion by the agonised play of mobile features as to
rush for relief to the “Tear-Room,” where they can
cry to heart’s content without inconveniencing more
stoical neighbours.</p>

<p>Though the actor’s tone is disagreeably unnatural,
his articulation is both clean-cut and sonorous. The
syllables crack on the ear like pistol-shots, sharply
distinct. I imagine that he is seldom inaudible. It
is a great pity that convention, if not law, still forbids
the appearance of men and women on the same stage,
since the mimicry of one sex by the other, triumphantly
deceptive in other particulars, breaks down at the
point of vocal imitation. The eye is tricked, but not
the ear. Yet peculiar attention is given to the training
and discipline of <em>onnagata</em>, or impersonators of
female parts. Formerly they were not only given the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
outward semblance of women by every contrivance
which the costumier and coiffeur could supply, but
were required to spend their lives from childhood in
feminine costume and society, that their masculine proclivities
might be as far as possible obliterated. Even
now their names stand first on the programme, their
dressing-rooms are locked on the inside, their influence
is paramount in the Actors’ Guild. The supremacy
of Mr. Danjuro is due in no small degree to his ability
to play both male and female characters with equal
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>. Notwithstanding every precaution and privilege,
the actor cannot acquire the intonation of an
actress. His reedy falsetto is a poor parody of the
musical tones in which Japanese women converse,
and the loss to a public which has never been caressed
by Sara Bernhardt’s golden voice or thrilled by
Mrs. Patrick Campbell’s may be sympathetically
imagined. But, though Tōkyō has no actresses, the
Women’s Theatre in Kyōto, in which are no actors,
might seem a partial set-off to this deficiency. In
fact, however, though the women are extremely clever
in simulating the gait and gestures of men&mdash;if I had
not been taken behind the scenes, I should have
believed myself in the wrong theatre&mdash;they are hopelessly
handicapped by physical weakness. The stage
is so enormous, and the performance so long, that an
artist may reckon on walking ten miles in the course
of the day, while the voice is severely taxed by the
prolonged stridency of declamation.</p>

<p>While the stage-woman, adroitly personated, is
often tolerable, the stage-child is an intolerable infliction.
Convention has decreed that it shall shriek
all its lines on one high monotonous note, and shriek
it does. There is no attempt at variety of tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
or naturalness of expression. When a steam-launch
emits similar sounds, we condone in a machine what
we resent in a human being. It is simply an ear-splitting
automaton. One turns with relief to watch
the children in the audience, who are evidently the
spoiled darlings of their relations. But, indeed, the
child seems never snubbed or thwarted in Japan. At
the termination of every act, while the curtains fall or
are drawn together, there is a scurry of tiny feet up
and down the parallel <em>hana-michi</em> (the flower-walks
which divide the auditorium), and, if some audacious
little intruders rush upon the stage itself, they are
greeted with indulgent laughter.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief obstacle to illusion, and the one
most easily remedied as regards scenic accessories, is
the enormous area of the stage. It is far too large
to be enclosed between “wings” and “flies,” while
the custom of exit and entry along the flower-walks
transgresses our cardinal principle of separating those
who act from those who look on. As a rule, the
supposed locality of the piece, be it palace or temple
or battle-field, is a wood-and-cardboard island in a sea
of bare boards, of which the circumference nearly
corresponds with that of a revolving section of the
stage, twenty or thirty feet in diameter, which turns
on lignum-vitæ wheels. While one scene is being
enacted, a second is being prepared behind, and at a
given signal the <em>eccyclema</em> is whirled round, carrying
away one set of actors and bringing on their successors.
Do not suppose, however, that realistic
effects are outside the range of the Meiji-za or Kabuki-za
management. I remember a melodrama, written
by a lieutenant in the Japanese navy, in which the
hero, though encumbered by a heavy piece of ordnance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
hoisted on his shoulders, cut down eight assailants
in turn in spite of a terrific storm, which drenched
the company with real rain and blew down real trees,
planted that afternoon!</p>

<p>The actor is a more important personage than the
author in most people’s eyes. Until this relation
shall be reversed, the Thespian cart is not likely to
leave the rut in which it moves. Meanwhile, a glance
at their respective positions may fitly conclude this
essay. Before Meiji, the present era of enlightenment,
the mummer was treated as a rogue and vagabond.
He was regarded with contempt as a <em>koyamono</em>, or
“occupant of a hut,” and placed on a par with mendicants.
In public places he was obliged to wear
a <em>mebakari-zukin</em> or hood, which covered head and
face all but the eyes, and was only allowed to frequent
particular restaurants. Unless he belonged to one of
the half-dozen theatrical families who ruled the stage
with oligarchic exclusiveness, monopolising the secrets
of the profession, the power to admit novices, and the
right to play particular parts, his progress was slow.
Beginning with the horse’s leg (<em>uma no ashi</em>), a limb
of the pantomimic charger, which was indispensable
to historic drama, he was obliged to buy or insinuate
his way by adoption to more important parts before
he could earn either fame or fortune. Nowadays all
that is changed. Free competition rules. The public
is his only patron. Without training or payment of
fees to the Ichikawa, the Onoye, or the Nakamura, a
successful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutant</i> can march by his own merits into
wealth and popularity. As he treads the flower-walks,
fans, purses, embroidered pouches will be showered at
his feet; to his dressing-room will come love-letters
innumerable, for the Japanese “matinée girl” is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
susceptible; in public he will be pointed out, the idol
of the masses; his crest will be on the tortoise-shell or
ivory pin, which adorns the high coiffure of the stage-struck
<em>musumé</em>; finally, should he ever reach the head
of his profession, he may hope to make as much as
£5000 in four weeks, far surpassing the modest income
of a prime minister or an archbishop.</p>

<div class="caption">The Heroine of a Problem-play.</div>
</div>

<p>But the author, instead of ruling the kingdom which
he creates, is in most cases no more than a theatrical
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</i>. In fact, the term “create” can only be
used with much qualification, for the genesis of a play
is curiously and multifariously planned. First, the
manager sends for the author, and indicates the subject
and period which he desires to form the bases of a
drama; the author prepares and submits two or three
drafts, from which the best is selected; then the cast
is appointed, and the chief actors are consulted about
their parts, which of course are modified to suit their
suggestions; then the composer is called in, and, if
the musical setting should lead to new alterations in
the libretto, the author has no choice but to submit.
When plays have to be constructed in this way, you
cannot expect them to have any more artistic value
than a London pantomime or “musical comedy.”
Nor has the author the satisfaction of salving the
wounds to “artistic conscience” with consolatory gold.
On the first run of a piece (the season is never longer
than four or five weeks at a time) he may receive £20;
a revival may bring him in £10 more, a provincial tour
yet another £10. On the whole, he will be lucky
to make £50, while the leading actor makes £5000.
But then the audiences do not pay their money for the
opportunity of solving historical problems or appreciating
intellectual artistry: their object is simply to feast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>eyes and ears on a sensational pageant, in which to
them the actor is king. They do not bestow a thought
on the power behind the throne, chained there by
ignorance and convention. Plays are sometimes published,
but their sale is insignificant. The aristocracy,
both of birth and intellect, hold too much aloof from a
plebeian amusement, which under higher conditions
might become a fruitful and immortal art. When I
think of Mr. Fukuchi, fettered by public taste, that
stupidest of Jupiters, to the Caucasus of picturesque
melodrama, while vulturine actors peck at his brains,
I wish that a chorus of Oceanides, winged ideas and
ideals from Paris, from London, and Christiania&mdash;could
cross the seas to Tōkyō and liberate Prometheus.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nothing is more difficult to eradicate than a British
misconception of foreign defects. French lubricity,
German clumsiness, Russian cruelty, are quite as much
articles of faith on this side of the Channel as Albion’s
perfidy on the other. Similarly, it is useless to controvert
the popular opinion that the geisha is generally
pretty and always improper. Her detractors have
seen an English opera bearing her name and traducing
her character: it is enough; they know. Nevertheless,
this opinion is founded on imperfect knowledge,
and requires much modification before it can be
received as even partially true. Etymologically, a
<em>gei-sha</em> is an accomplished person; socially, she is an
entertainer, who has been trained from the age of
seven or eight to dance or sing for the amusement of
guests at a dinner-party. Probably her parents have
leased her for a certain number of years to a teacher,
who undertakes to board and train her, to procure
engagements and to chaperon her, to pay a fixed sum
to her family as well as a tax to the Government, in
return for all of which a sufficient recompense is
assured by the fees which a talented artist is able to
earn. Less frequently she lives at home and obtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
engagements through an agent, who receives only a
percentage of her gains. The training is continuous
and severe. To a foreigner the dancing will appear
graceful but monotonous; it has none of the free,
vigorous motion which we associate with the term:
on the other hand, for the connoisseur each gesture
is significant, each pose symbolic. To appreciate
many of the “dances,” requiring hours of patient
rehearsal, it would be necessary to catch continual
allusion to poems, legends, and flowers, with which
the treasure-house of Japanese memory is stored.
Those who would deny the applicability of the term
“music” to “the strummings and squealings of
Orientals,” would yet admit that both the <em>koto</em> and
<em>samisen</em> (the stringed instruments most in vogue) are
not to be mastered without constant practice, and the
irregular rhythm of the songs, with their abrupt intervals
and capricious repetitions, cannot be easy to
render until the voice has attained extreme flexibility.
On the mysteries of Japanese music, however,
seeing that the best authorities are at variance, only
an expert dare pronounce judgment. To return to
the question of the social status of the geisha, I
should say that it corresponds more exactly with that
of a Parisian actress than of an Athenian <em>hetaira</em>.
Convention having banished the actress from the
Japanese stage, the geisha takes her place as the
natural recipient of masculine homage. She is much
courted, and sometimes makes a brilliant match. There
are a large number who make the profession an excuse
for attracting rich admirers, just as the name of
“actress” in more Puritan climes will cover a multitude
of sins. But a professional courtesan she is not:
her favours are not always for sale to the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
bidder. When her short reign is over at the age of
twenty-five, she generally imparts to a younger generation
the secrets of professional success. Among
these the art of conversation is not the least important.
To parry indiscreet advances and to bandy compliments
enter as much into her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> as the playing of
“Kitsune ken” or “fox-forfeit,” in which no little
agility is needed to represent at the right moment
the fox, the man, and the gun on facile fingers.
Childish of course the geisha is, like most of her
younger countrywomen; sometimes dangerous and
fickle, as her popular nickname of “Nekko,” the cat,
testifies; but virtuous as well, in many cases, where
she has enough independence and strength of character
to resist the flattering importunity of fame’s innumerable
suitors.</p>

<p>If one of these aspire to win her affection, or merely
to make her acquaintance, he has many advantages
over the callow youths who wait, like lackeys, at the
stage-door of a Western theatre. He is spared the
preliminary purgatory of appealing letters, of supplicatory
presents, which may easily fail to secure the
desired access. He is not forced to share with a crowd
of jealous or indifferent strangers the bitter joy of her
nightly apotheosis, when her smiles and wiles must be
lavished in promiscuous appeal. He has merely to
dine at the tea-house with which she, or her employer,
has made a mutually advantageous contract: there,
on sufficient notice, she will arrive with her duenna,
ready to perform, if need be, for his delight alone,
while the semi-privacy of the entertainment affords
him every opportunity of pressing his suit. As a rule,
however, the geisha performs in parties of two, or
three, or more, according to the number of guests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Often the convivial character of the occasion tends to
lower the standard of art involved; indeed, such
feasts are apt to degenerate into orgies. To realise
the æsthetic possibilities of an art which is only at its
lowest bacchanalian, we must quit the tea-house, that
temple of the senses, and seek the sacred city of
Kyōto, where palace and monastery raise, like antique
junks, their majestic or quaintly carven heads above
white waves of cherry-blossom....</p>

<p>It is April. While English weather is struggling in
spasmodic furies of wind and rain to escape the clutch
of winter, here the enfranchised spring creeps, fairy-like,
from plain to height on rosy sandals. First
Tōkyō, whose hundred miles of unpaved thoroughfare
fatigue the foot and offend the eye with naked dreariness,
is clothed with draperies of fleecy pink. The
spacious parks of Ueno and Shiba are thronged with
gazing multitudes, who ride or saunter all day long
through flower-encumbered avenues. At night the
river-reaches of Mukōjima are packed with pleasure-boats,
whose lanterns gleam like fire-flies beneath the
pale mass of overhanging bloom. Yamaguchi San,
who by trade is a rice merchant but by nature a poet,
has written in the intervals of business, which is not
brisk at this time of year, a little sheaf of poems, each
consisting of three lines, which run perpendicularly
down strips of iridescent rice-paper. So far as their
purport can be construed into grosser forms of verse, I
take it to be as follows:</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“Put on your brightest <em>kimono</em>,</p>
<p class="verse">O Haru San, and let us go!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“Bring ivory chop-sticks, lacquer-cup,</p>
<p class="verse">And rice and wine, that we may sup.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“On honourable trees is set</p>
<p class="verse">A rosy-petalled coronet.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“The shine of day, the sheen of night,</p>
<p class="verse">Are drowned in cherry-blossom-light.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“We have no need of sun or star</p>
<p class="verse">To revel at Mukōjima.”</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>But Mukōjima is no more to be compared with
Yoshino than Rosherville with Stonehenge. The trees
which line the broad Sumidagawa are beautiful but
modern; their festal boughs are familiarised and a
little vulgarised by the loud merry-making of cockney
crowds; all this shouting and laughing recall a barbarian’s
bank-holiday. Far westward, on the ridges of
Yoshino, where no modern city disturbs the silence of
the imperial <em>tumuli</em>, encircled by a low granite fence
and enclosing dusty gold relics of dead kings, grow
the Thousand Cherry-Trees of immemorial renown.
Motoöri sang of them; Hiroshigi painted them; Jimmu.
Tenno, the first of the Mikados, in his mausoleum
fifteen miles away, is hardly more venerable than they.
Every year pilgrims pass through the bronze gateway
of the Zo-o-do Temple and climb the mountain side to
rest beneath the canopy of tender, billowy blossom,
which broods like an ever-renascent cloud of beauty
above the Yamato plain, endeared by thirteen centuries
of history and romance. Many pleasure-seekers mix
with the white-robed pilgrims, who belong for the
most part to distant villages and look on religion as an
excellent excuse for change of interest and change of
scene. Heedless of theology and harassed by no
conviction of original sin, they return, like happy
children from a picnic, with eyes brightened by the sea
of colour and spirits clarified by pure mountain air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Soon the green hills are carpeted with flakes of soft
flowerage; the brief splendour of the Thousand Trees
is over; the scattered hamlets and holy mounds resume
their ordinary quietude.</p>

<p>At Kyōto the cult of the national flower culminates
in an annual celebration, the Miyako-odori, a spectacular
ballet with choric interludes. For many years
the same poet, an old resident, has been assigned
the task of composing appropriate lyrics, in which
the glories of some historic or legendary hero blend
with the praises of the blushing <em>sakura</em>. Musicians,
painters, dancers, are engaged to elaborate with auxiliary
sound, design, and movement the series of dream-pictures
which his fancy has evoked. But words and
notes are really subsidiary to the dancing: the tale of
the poet is chiefly told by the winding feet and waving
arms, the ever-changing pose and mimicry, of the
most highly trained geisha in Japan. These number
as many as seventy, of whom eighteen combine the
functions of choir and orchestra, now chanting, now
accompanying on drum and mandoline the statuesque
or processional development of the choregraphic
theme. The Hanami-Kōji, specially set apart for
such representations, is not easy to find. Though
within the precincts of the theatrical quarter, it stands
a little apart from the other houses, such as the
Gion-za Theatre, and is far less capacious; in fact, it
bears about the same proportion to its huge, banner-flaunting
brethren as the smaller Queen’s Hall to
Drury Lane. The structure, too, is entirely different
from theirs. Three sides of the building are reserved
for the performers. Instead of the parallel <em>hana-michi</em>,
trisecting the audience and sloping from stage to
entrance, two dancing platforms skirt the “pit” on left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and right and join the extremities of the scene: on
them sit the singing-girls, concealed at first by cotton
curtains. No room remains for the public but the
floor between the platforms and a gallery, which faces
the drop-scene of the stage proper. As the performance
only lasts an hour, it is repeated four or five
times in the afternoon and evening of twenty days,
and the price of admission to the best (gallery) seats is
fifty <em>sen</em>, about one shilling, for economy and simplicity
are conspicuous in this essentially popular entertainment.</p>

<p>The dance is preceded by a ceremonious reception
of great interest to the foreign visitor. He is conducted
to an ante-room and requested to participate in
<em>O Cha-no-yu</em>, an august tea-making. The preparation
of this aristocratic refreshment must be conducted in
accordance with inviolable rules, invented or rather
modified by the great Taikō himself, who, not content
with military glory, desired to regulate the boudoir as
imperiously as the State, in this resembling Queen
Anne, who “would sometimes counsel take and sometimes
tea.” The twelve utensils employed must be
separately cleansed and waved in air by the demure
but smart damsel who presides with becoming dignity
and science, every gesture, every operation of her
deft hands being prescribed by rigid etiquette. After
twenty minutes of silent incantation, as it seems, the
dainty sorceress has brewed her potion. Then a
careful sub-sorceress, who has attentively waited on
the principal witch, prostrates herself at the feet of
each of the guests, touches the floor with her forehead,
and, as she presents a cup of thick, green <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillon</i>,
murmurs, “Oh, gracious stranger, deign to taste this
honourable tea!” Long as the tea ceremonies appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to the uninitiated, they are considerably shortened and
imperfectly observed by the tea-drinkers, who, it is
feared, break a thousand and one rules in uncouth
efforts to copy the better educated Japanese.</p>

<p>As seen from the strangers’ gallery (for the majority
of humble coolies and small shopkeepers have been
waiting in patient line until the august tea has been
absorbed by their betters, and now sit, packed in tiny
compartments, on the floor of the pit) this liliputian
theatre has much in common with the galanty-show
which first kindled a passion for the stage in distant
childhood. The drop-scenes are scarcely more than
nine feet high, and of such thin material that through
their pale pattern of willow and pine the shining of
candles is discerned. It would not surprise me if
they grew gradually whiter and brighter, serving at
last as the medium for a droll shadow-pantomime
of fantastic silhouettes. But even the children would
not have come to see that, since their eyes have
often followed at home the ingenious shadow-play of
parental hands behind the paper-panelled <em>shōji</em>. Rarer
and more exotic must be the show to please this easily
amused but quickly sated audience. Suddenly the
curtains on either side lift, disclosing to the left nine
geisha, holding <em>taiko</em> or <em>tzuzumi</em>, circular drums and
drums conical, beaten with batons or smacked with
open palm; to the right, nine more, with <em>koto</em> and
<em>samisen</em>, plucking the strings with curved finger or
ivory plectrum: all are much powdered and painted,
but soberly attired in black and gold. The prelude
lacks melody, lacks harmony, as we understand them,
but the sharp, staccato cries, emphasised by drum-taps,
the antiphonal, diminishing shrieks, which seem to
punctuate a nasal, wailing recitative, insensibly induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a nervous tension of disquieting suspense. The time
is most exact: the drums rattle, the zithers clang, in
perfect unison. Then along the narrow platforms in
front of the musicians issue simultaneously from beneath
the gallery two slender files of geisha, whose pink and
blue <em>kimono</em> suggest the hues of cherry-blossom and
the else cloudless sky. Like running ribbons, they
wind towards the stage, festooning at last into a momentary
bow before the famous gate, called O Kuru-ma-yose,
of which the curiously carven peonies and
phœnixes are admirably reproduced, evoking instant
recognition. While the dancers disappear through
that pictured portal and the curtain falls on the first
figure of the dance, let me briefly indicate the subject
and intention of this year’s fantasy.</p>

<p>Its hero is Hideyoshi, often entitled Taikō (the
retired regent), next to Iyeyasu perhaps the most
notable name in all Japanese history&mdash;so proverbially
notable that Cromwell and Napoleon are not more
vividly impressed on the memory of their countrymen.
His dramatic rise from rung to rung of the feudal
ladder, from peasant’s hut to a regent’s palace, which
none but a noble had occupied before him; the contrast
of his mean appearance, which caused him to be
dubbed “The Monkey,” with his grandiose achievements,
which included the commercial supremacy of
Ōsaka and the subjugation of Corea; his dreams of
world-empire; the patronage of art, which led him to
summon a congress of tea-drinkers and to take an
active part in the presentation of <em>Nō</em> plays; the adroit
concentration of power in his own person, despite the
jealousy of patricians and the victories of contemporary
generals; these and many other circumstances of
his career loom large in patriotic tradition. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
eclipsed by Iyeyasu in statesmanship, for the latter
founded a constitution and established a dynasty,
which lasted two hundred years, and might have lasted
longer but for foreign intervention; yet Hideyoshi’s
is the more picturesque, the more striking personality.
Perhaps it would not be straining an historical parallel
to allege that the great soldier of Kyōto prepared the
way for the great legislator of Yedo as effectively as
Julius Cæsar prepared the way for Augustus. Be this
so or not, it is plain that the beginning of the seventeenth
century after Christ in Japan and the end of
the last century before Christ in Italy coincided with
similar transitions from militant anarchy to peaceful
despotism. The golden age of the Tokugawa may
be cited as an argument for imperial rule with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax Romana</i> of the Cæsars. It might be supposed
that the names of Iyeyasu and Hideyoshi have no
more virtue as a rallying-cry for their descendants
than the watchwords of Roundhead and Cavalier have
for us. But such is not the case. Subtly reincarnate
in the cities which they glorified in life, their spirits
still give battle after death in the bloodless field of
civic rivalry. Tōkyō is still Yedo, the Petersburg of
the empire, created by a despot’s will and the centre
of law, of authority, of administration; but it is to
Kyōto, as to Moscow, the holy city, that lovers of art
and of religion are inevitably attracted. Hers are
still the finer temples, the lovelier fabrics, the nobler
legacies of Old Japan. One thing, however, she has
not, which the capital has&mdash;a fitting monument of her
greatest citizen. Whereas the mausoleum of Iyeyasu
at Nikkō is such a masterpiece of commemorative
gratitude, expressed in the language of plastic and
decorative art, that “whoever has not seen Nikk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>ō
[so runs the saw] has no right to use the word <em>kekkō</em>
(splendid),” the conqueror of Corea, the arbiter of
august tea-making, lacks the tribute of a monumental
tomb. This stain on the scutcheon of Kyōto is to be
speedily wiped out. Now that the Emperor has transferred
his court to the eastern capital and made the
Tokugawa citadel his own, the western merchants are
eager to redress the balance by building on the heights
of Maruyama for the glory of Hideyoshi and the
bewilderment of tourists such a triumph of memorial
architecture that Iyeyasu shall at last he outshone
and the connotation of <em>kekkō</em> be fraught with ampler
meaning. The plans are drawn, the work begun,
patriots and pilgrims have subscribed thousands of
<em>yen</em>, the best modern artists in wood and bronze have
been charged with the heavy privilege of surpassing
their illustrious predecessors. Whether they succeed
or not, the Hideyoshi monument was a subject so rich
in suggestion, so popular in itself, so complex in its
appeal, that the poet of the Miyako-odori could not
wish for a better or more burning theme. And that is
why the pink-and-blue geisha made their first exit
through O Kuruma-yose, which Hidari Jingoro, the
immortal left-handed carpenter, adorned with marvellous
birds and flowers when commissioned to carve
a royal gateway for his master’s, the Taikō’s, palace at
Fushimi.</p>

<p>The next scene represented Hideyoshi’s garden. It
is no ordinary garden, whatever foreigners may think,
who merely see in it an appropriate background for
the swaying flower-like bodies of the dancing-girls.
It is a masterpiece of the celebrated æsthete, Kobori
Enshu, and the artful disposition of lake and lantern,
pebble and pine, may symbolise, for all I know, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
divine truth or philosophic precept. My neighbour (a
Buddhist neophyte, whose enthusiasm is tempered by
erudition) points out to me the Moon-Washing Fountain,
the Stone of Ecstatic Contemplation, and the
Bridge of the Pillar of the Immortals, but it seems
that the exigencies of scenic space have so fatally
curtailed the Mound facing the Moon that the exact
meaning of the parabolic design is made obscure, if not
heretical. It is not in my power to reassure him, so I
welcome with relief the reappearance of the dancers,
who, bearing flowers in one hand and a fan in the
other, step gaily out of the garden and, posing, perching,
pirouetting, flutter with deliberate grace through a
maze of correlated motions. I do not dare to ask if
their gestures point a moral: it is wiser to assume
with Keats that “beauty is truth, truth beauty,”
and to follow with undistracted eye the solemn prettiness
of these human dragon-flies. For their gauzy
<em>kimono</em> sleeves and red-pepper-coloured <em>obi</em> recall the
wings and hue of a giant dragon-fly, which dominates
in its pride of national emblem the principal bridge
over the Kamogawa. And, whether they poise flower
on fan or fan on flower, or revolve with open fan
extended behind their triple-tressed coiffure, they dart
here and settle there with almost the unconscious,
automatic smoothness of bird or insect. Proximity
destroys this illusion. Watched from the subjacent
vantage of the floor, the features of these tiny <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</i>
are seen to wear that fixity of resolute attention
which few children when engrossed in a performance
are able to repress. The art of concealing art is hard
to learn. Their elder sisters smile continually behind
<em>taiko</em> and <em>samisen</em>, but the gravity of the childish troupe
is more in keeping with the poet’s retrospective vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope the stage-carpenter atoned for his unorthodox
abbreviation of Enshu’s lesson in landscape by the
exquisite view of the monastery of Uji Bridge. Nestling
in the lap of pine-forested hills, this ancient temple
of Byōdō-in has been for at least six hundred years
the protective centre of vast tea-plantations where is
grown the finest tea for native taste, called Gyokuro,
or Jewelled Dew. But Uji Bridge is famous also for
its fire-flies, which on warm nights flash like living
jewels beside the stream, to the joy of countless sightseers,
eager to catch and cage them. Throughout the
ensuing dance many eyes were diverted from the
geisha to the sparkling play of emerald motes across
the mimic Ujigawa. This time the girls wore kerchiefs
such as peasant women wear when, with heads
thus guarded and skirts rolled upward to the knee,
they toil among the tea-plants. Then, unfolding and
waving the kerchiefs, while a soloist intoned a
rhapsody in honour of “the Great Councillor, whose
memory lives for ever in the fragrant sweetness of
the Jewelled Dew,” they moved in pairs along the
platform, alternately kneeling and rising, with arms
extended or intertwined, their gradual retrocession
signifying, as I learn, the reluctant withdrawal of
summer.</p>

<p>Autumn succeeds. Momiji-Yama, or Maple Mountain,
deeply mantled in myriads of reddening leaves,
gives the cue to the now melancholy, almost stationary
languor of gliding figures: no longer dragon-flies or
humming-birds, they drift slowly, one by one, into the
crimson gorge, and are lost among the maple-leaves.
At this point the floral march of the seasons is abruptly
broken, as if to forbid too hasty interpretation, by the
fall of tricolour curtains, richly embroidered in scarlet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
blue, and gold with Hideyoshi’s crest, the large fan-like
leaf of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pawlonia Imperialis</i>.</p>

<p>The five-storeyed pagoda of Omuro Gosho, outlined
in snow against the wintry landscape, signalises an
ascent from temporal to eternal beauty. To this
monastic palace ex-mikados came after abdication; it
had no abbots but those of imperial blood. And the
next scene, presenting the Daibutsu, or great Buddha
of Hideyoshi, is elegantly illustrative of the Buddhist
teaching of permanence in transition. The first
wooden image, 160 feet high, erected by the Taiko
in 1588, was destroyed by earthquake in 1596. After
his death his widow constructed a second in bronze,
which was almost completed save for the casting of the
head when fire devoured it in 1603. Lastly, his son,
Hideyori, persuaded by perfidious Ieyaysu to waste
his substance in rearing a yet more colossal figure, was
forbidden to consecrate it by a message from the
Shōgun, who chose to discover in the Chinese inscription
on the bell (“On the east I welcome the
bright moon, on the west I bid farewell to the setting
sun”) a prophecy of his own waning and Hideyoshi’s
waxing radiance. A second earthquake in 1662, corrosive
lightnings in 1775 and 1798, consumed successive
Buddhas in the same shrine, but the present god,
whose gilded head and shoulders alone are visible,
scaling fifty-eight feet from ground to ceiling, has
defied the strokes of fate for ninety-nine years, and
recalls to pious beholders the original builder’s piety,
triumphant at last through the irresistible resurrection
of deity.</p>

<p>Resurrection&mdash;the recurrence of spring and the renovation
of fame&mdash;crowns the final movement of this
transcendental ballet. The Hideyoshi monument, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
it partly is and wholly shall be, rises tier above tier on
heaven-scaling stairs, approached by temples and
groves which will one day vie in splendour with the
carven gateways, the gigantic cryptomerias of Nikkō.
In a joyous finale the dancers pose, wreathed about
the central summit of the monument, while cascades of
red and green fire play on them from the wings; then,
strewing the steps with cherry-blossom and waving
provocative clusters in the faces of the spectators as
they pass, the double stream of geisha flows back with
graceful whirls and eddies between banks of deafening
minstrelsy; the curtains rustle down, the fires flicker
out; the Miyako-odori is no more.</p>

<p>As I ponder on this fascinating little spectacle,
planned by artists and presented by fairies, the memory
returns of a ballet, incalculably more magnificent, which
the rich municipality of Moscow organised in honour
of Nicholas II., Emperor of all the Russias, on the
occasion of his coronation. I remember that thousands
of roubles were expended; that the decorations and
costumes blazed with ostentation; that armies of half-dressed
women performed acrobatic feats in searching
electric light. If any flowers of imagination had bloomed
in the contriver’s mind, they had been pitilessly crushed
by costumiers, scene-painters, and ballet-masters. The
result was a meretricious chaos of meaningless display.
Hidden from the eyes of Moscow merchants and revealed
to the patient artisans of Kyōto is that spirit
of beauty, which, out of cotton and paper and Bengal
lights can fashion a poem, so lovely that its simple
schemes of form and colour haunt the memory like
music, so profound that the deepest instincts of the
beholder may be stirred by communion with the faith
in which his fathers laboured and died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>It may well have been, however, that the shaven
stripling beside me who so kindly unravelled threads
of occasional doctrine from the glistening web of
Terpsichore was almost alone in his desire to be
edified. As he formally took his leave, most of the
pittites rushed with laughter up the hill to the Chionin
Temple, before which stands a marvellous and
patriarchal cherry-tree. Lamps were hung in its far-reaching
boughs, and all night long the light-hearted
Kyōto citizens chattered and sang beneath its multitudinous
blossom.</p>

<p>The connection between Buddhism and geishadom
was recalled to me in a much less poetic setting by a
peculiar play, which for seven nights filled the commodious
theatre of Tsuruga, a delightful port overlooking
the finest harbour on the Sea of Japan. The
piece was called “Shimazomasa,” and the audience
was moved to extraordinary demonstrations of delight
by a very long soliloquy delivered for at least ten
minutes by a Buddhist priest, who, seated on a mat in
the centre of the stage and tapping his knees with a
fan, excited my liveliest curiosity as to the purport of
his tirade. Could it be a parody on pulpit eloquence?
Would these pious townsmen, whose bay was lined
with temples, tolerate such mockery of sacred things?
The curtain fell and drew up again: the actor was
forced to repeat his glib soliloquy. Then, to my
extreme bewilderment, the priest was no more seen,
and a tortuous but intelligible melodrama ensued,
revealing the thefts and treacheries of a geisha, who
came in the last act to a miserable end. The next
night I returned, and being in time for the first act,
which I had missed on the previous occasion, discovered
that the plausible preacher was the geisha disguised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
She had escaped from prison, and was recounting to
herself the advantages which she expected to reap
from the garb of a friar. “Young girls will come to
me, craving amulets and charms for their lovers. Thus
I shall know the names of honourable young men, who
will not be slow to make my acquaintance. And, when
we have sipped tea and talked of many pleasant things
together, at the right time I shall whisper that it is no
priest who is honoured by their august friendship, but
Shimazomasa, the geisha. Moreover, I am sure to
succeed, for a preacher ought to be a good-looking
man. It is then easier for the hearers to keep their
eyes fixed on his face; otherwise their eyes wander
and they forget to listen.” It has been pointed out to
me since that passages in this delectable sermon were
taken bodily from the “Makura Zoshi” (“Pillow
Sketches”), the work of a lady-novelist of the eleventh
century. But plagiarism is no sin in the eyes of a
Japanese dramatist, and the great merit was to have
hit on an original situation. The manager of the
theatre was so conscious of this, that, when a second
play, entitled “Pistorigoto” (“Robbery under Arms”),
failed to draw as well as its predecessor, he boldly
transferred the incident without rhyme or reason to
the plot, which was neither improved nor worsened by
the addition. I was grateful, too, to the author of
“Shimazomasa” for a touch of fancy, which redeemed
the realism of his sensational story. During a love
scene between three suitors and the heroine, who had
regained for a time prestige and prosperity, a symbolic
geisha, bearing no relation to the personages of the
piece, chanted in an upper barred chamber, adjoining
the outer wall of the tea-house in which the action was
proceeding, snatches of erotic song, praising the joys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of love but foretelling the heavy Nemesis which, sooner
or later, overtakes light women. In a play of Æschylus
this would have been Erinyes on the Atridean roof,
terrible and invisible, presaging doom. But I fear
that he who wrote “Shimazomasa” had no deeper
design than the interpolation of a taking song, since
popular drama is as untroubled as the popular mind by
haunting shadows of death and destiny.</p>

<p>“As for the common people, they have songs of their own, which
conform as far as possible to classical models, but are much mixed

<p class="noindent">Poetry is the most meretricious of arts. Among its
adherents are more unconscious snobs than in any of
the classes distinguished and damned by Thackeray.
This is because extrinsic ornament, the use of words
to dazzle or conceal, like jewels or cosmetics, has more
effect on most readers than intrinsic beauty, be it
depth of feeling or exactitude of thought. Poets are
to be excused, and often applauded, for pandering to
our eyes and ears instead of ministering to our souls.
It is better to admire a mean thought or paltry
emotion, draped in exquisite folds of melody and
colour, than to deplore a fine theme, marred by vile
and clumsy treatment, just as a plain woman, dressed
to satisfy the most critical arbiter of elegance, is more
pleasing to contemplate than a bank-holiday belle,
however comely, in discordant frock and feathers.
Now, a beautiful woman beautifully robed is as rare
as a poem of which the sense is æsthetically equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the form; hence, words being cheaper than ideas and
pretty things more plentiful than pretty features, we
delight in second-rate women and in second-rate
poetry, for want of first-rate, until, the taste being
corrupted, we are inclined to endorse Théophile
Gautier’s canon, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La perfection de la forme c’est la
vertu</i>. The farther we follow this misleading maxim,
the farther we leave behind us that most vital poetry,
life itself. Often this fact is not perceived, for
secondary art has generated secondary emotion: we
derive pleasure from allusion rather than illusion, from
sleight of wit rather than strength of spirit. Tennyson
tells an Arthurian story, or wishes to, and his listeners
are so charmed by the irrelevant embroidery of
sound and simile that they do not perceive that what
they obediently consider a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> barbarian, the hero, is
really a Broad Church country-parson in fancy dress.
Mr. Swinburne writes an Athenian play, or intends
to, and his readers are so ravished by the splendour
of intrusive rhetoric that they are in no mood to distinguish
between archaic piety and nineteenth-century
free-thought. Thus the modern crowns his Muse
with paper roses, cleverly manufactured, while the
true flower blushes undisturbed or fades in humbler
keeping.</p>

<p>Fortunately it happens from time to time that the
caprice of fashion lights upon a real rose, which is at
once admired not only by the connoisseurs, but by the
uncultivated crowd, which has never been taught to
appreciate paper roses. Only it is to be observed
that the former class retain their reputation by denying
the name of rose to the new flower: it is a cowslip, a
daisy&mdash;nothing more. Having ceased to be meretricious,
the kind of verse I mean has ceased to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
poetry, in the opinion of these judges; on the contrary,
they insist that, in their eyes, by discarding the
frippery of language, which they rate so highly, the
author of it is no poet, but a vulgar writer. And so,
in the highest sense of the word, he is. He has
touched the heart of the vulgar; he has found a
common factor, which will “go” successfully “into”
any assemblage of figures. Take, for instance, three
capital instances of vulgar songs, which, as it seems to
me, comply with the conditions demanded of poetry,
that it shall communicate at once a vivid picture and
a direct emotion. When Mr. Albert Chevalier sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse2">And it don’t seem a dy too much;</p>
<p class="verse">There ain’t a lydy livin’ in the land</p>
<p class="verse2">As I’d swop for my dear old Dutch,”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">the pathos of life-long love is conveyed quite as
poignantly, if not so verbosely, as by Goethe in
“Hermann and Dorothea.” It is not literature, but
it is poetry. When Mlle. Yvette Guilbert sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<p class="verseq">“J’ termine ma lettre en t’embrassant,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">the pathos of recollected innocence in a prostitute of
Montmartre is more intense, because less diffusely
obtained, than by Victor Hugo in the case of Fantine.
The chanson of Aristide Bruant is not literature, but
it is poetry. The highest instance of non-literary
poetry is afforded by “The Barrack-room Ballads.” It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
is impossible to deny that the best of them are as vivid
and as poignant as any poems ever written. Yet they
deliberately distress conventional ears by their substitution
of power for beauty as governing principle.
But even they retain too much literary skill to illustrate
my theory. How surprised were many Londoners
when Alphonse Daudet was touched by the
rollicking doggerel of “Her golden hair was hanging
down her back!” To them there was nothing
pathetic in the refrain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Oh, Flo! What a change, you know!</p>
<p class="verse2">When she left the village she was shy;</p>
<p class="verse">But alas! and alack! She’s come back</p>
<p class="verse2">With a naughty little twinkle in her eye.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">But the distinguished novelist, with his fine sense of
the thinly-veiled tragedies of life, was touched. The
young gentleman from college, the labourer’s daughter;
the visit to London, the descent of the girl from stupid
simplicity to knowing naughtiness&mdash;the whole sordid,
pitiable tale lay for him in a badly-written ditty,
cynically set to a dancing tune. It takes a foreigner,
whose ears have been sealed by fate to the siren-voices
of an alien literature, to make such discoveries as this,
to discern poetry where literature is woefully wanting.
Therefore I am not in the least disconcerted to learn
that the Japanese “common people have songs of
their own ... despised by all well-bred persons,”
but which illustrate for me this familiar phenomenon
of non-literary poetry. As a foreigner, I am better
fitted to appreciate them. When O Wakachio San

<p class="verse">Scan thy face, sleeping:</p>
<p class="verse">By a strange woman</p>
<p class="verse6">Thou art beloved.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">If the singing-girl’s vulgar song can stir at times as
keen a throb of sympathy as the ditties which celebrate
a “coster’s courtship” or a gigolette’s captivity, yet
this effect and colloquial phrasing are the only points
of resemblance. The points of difference are so
numerous that, before quoting other specimens from
a geisha’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répertoire</i>, something should be said of
the characteristics peculiar to this and all Japanese
verse.</p>

<p>The most obvious trait of recognised and unrecognised
poems is their brevity. The great majority of
them consist of three, four, or five lines, in which the
number of syllables is either five or seven. Even the
so-called Naga-uta (long songs), which enjoyed a
short period of popular favour, seldom ran to more
than a few dozen lines. Oldest and most classical of
metres is the Tanka, a stanza of thirty-one syllables,
and a Tanka competition is held every New Year,
for which a theme is chosen by the Emperor. In
January 1896 thousands of amateur poets composed
“Congratulations Compared to a Mountain”; in the
following year they sang of “Pine-trees Reflected in
Water.” The Royal Family itself takes part, and the
whole nation thus inaugurates the year with libations
of lyrical enthusiasm. Motoöri’s famous comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of Japanese patriotism to cherry-blossom radiant on
the hills at sunrise is a good example of the Tanka:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Shikishima no</p>
<p class="verse">Yamato-gokoro wo</p>
<p class="verse">Hito towaba,</p>
<p class="verse">Asahi ni niou</p>
<p class="verse">Yama zakura bana.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This may be rendered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Heart of our Island,</p>
<p class="verse">Heart of Yamato,</p>
<p class="verse">If one should ask you</p>
<p class="verse6">What it may be;</p>
<p class="verse">Fragrance is wafted</p>
<p class="verse">Through morning sunlight</p>
<p class="verse">Over the mountain,</p>
<p class="verse6">Cherry-trees bloom.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">But the Hokku or Haikai, which dates from the
fifteenth century, imprisons the soul of wit in a cell of
even briefer dimensions. It gives the Tanka fourteen
syllables start, and covers the course in three strides
of five, seven, and five. The pace is so swift that
it almost always requires an exegetic field-glass (a
microscope and a race of animalcula were perhaps a
fitter comparison) to estimate the astonishing triumphs
of this wee Pegasus. One of the winners established
this remarkable record:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Asagao ni</p>
<p class="verse2">Tsurube torarete,</p>
<p class="verse">Morai mizu.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The naked eye perceives in this, indistinctly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">By convolvulus</p>
<p class="verse2">Well bucket taken:</p>
<p class="verse">Gift-water.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Mr. B. H. Chamberlain’s powerful glasses reveal the
merit and the secret of this achievement so clearly
that I borrow them for the readers use. “The
poetess Chiyo,” it appears, “having gone to her well
one morning to draw water, found that some tendrils
of convolvulus had twined themselves round the
rope. As a poetess and a woman of taste, she could
not bring herself to disturb the dainty blossoms. So,
leaving her own well to the convolvuli, she went out
and begged water of a neighbour.” Both Tanka and
Haikai may enter for the prizes of polite literature,
but the Dodoitsu, being reserved for vulgar songs, is
“despised by all well-bred persons.” As reasonably
might the plebeian “moke” of ’Enery ’Awkins aspire
to run at Ascot or Goodwood, as the Dodoitsu be
classed with Haikai and Tanka! Culture ignores it;
society excludes it from the list of intellectual amusements.
Yet its inferiority is sometimes more apparent
than real. The metre is a happy medium between
the two aristocratic favourites, since it consists of four
lines, containing twenty-six syllables in all; three lines
of seven syllables are clenched by a finale of five. It
very often enshrines a sweet fancy, a delicate image,
a chiselled exclamation of grief, or faith, or roguery.
The nearest analogue to all three would be the epigram,
were it not that the Oriental poet frequently aims at
nothing more than a pictorial flash; a landscape seen
by lightning, a life divined by instinct; a momentary
miniature, not a condensed conclusion. I can think of
but one English poem which partially follows the same
method, Robert Browning’s “Apparitions”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“Such a starved bank of moss</p>
<p class="verse2">Till, that May-morn,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<p class="verse">Blue ran the flash across:</p>
<p class="verse2">Violets were born!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“World&mdash;how it walled about</p>
<p class="verse2">Life with disgrace</p>
<p class="verse">Till God’s own smile came out:</p>
<p class="verse2">That was thy face!”</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Yet, bright and clean-cut though it be, this gem is
clouded by metaphors which would puzzle the Japanese
intellect. It would fail to grasp the meaning of “a
starved bank”; it would miss the identity of “God’s
smile” with a human face. Personification and metaphor
lie outside its limits: even the simile is rare.
In the forty or fifty Dodoitsu which I have collected
and translated no simile is employed, unless both
branches are plainly indicated. They abound in fancy;
they lack imagination. They derive their very force
from this limpet-like allegiance to fact, their suggestiveness
from the assurance that the quick-witted but
unimaginative reader will associate one fact with others
of the same order and not be misled by the vagaries of
Western vision. To the Western mind, on the other
hand, this association, wanting in his experience, will
sometimes need explanation; at other times the meaning
is crystal-clear. There are shades of significance,
touches of tenderness, which escape translation because
dependent on grammatical peculiarities which no
European tongues possess. The personal pronoun,
generally unexpressed, by its absence generalises and
so humanises the passion of a lover’s cry; a reticence
is gained which accords well with the shrinking delicacy
of a sensitive heart. When expressed, the word for
“I” will connote submission, the word for “thou”
lordship or lovership, by a double sense, impossible to
convey. Thus, the very structure of Japanese verse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
even in the case of vulgar songs, forbids that literary
luxuriance which makes modern English poetry “meretricious”
because tricked out with superfluous gewgaws.
You cannot daub such a tiny profile with Tennysonian
enamel or Swinburnian rouge. On the other hand,
it were absurd to pretend that the Tanka, much less
the Dodoitsu, is often of superlative value. For one
which embeds in amber a scene or sentiment of exceptional
worth, a thousand will deserve as much immortality
as an ingenious riddle or far-fetched pun. Yet,
it being conceded that their literary pretensions amount
to nil, a foreign student will find in the hundreds of
Dodoitsu, published anonymously in paper-covered
volumes, which cost about three farthings, an inexhaustible
fund of plebeian sentimentality and humour.</p>

<p>Apology should perhaps be offered for the very imperfect
mould in which I have attempted to recast
the Dodoitsu. If the reader will repeat to himself,
dwelling equally on each syllable, the following poem,
he will remark three things: first, the absence of
rhyme; secondly, the liquid lapse of melodious words;
thirdly, the sudden jerk with which it terminates:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Nushi to neru toki</p>
<p class="verse">Makura ga iranu</p>
<p class="verse">Tagaï-chigaï no</p>
<p class="verse6">O te makura.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">I have adopted a metre which avoids rhyme and
ends abruptly, but runs more swiftly than the original.
I have prefixed a title. Thus the preceding poem
becomes&mdash;</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Pillow Song.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Sleeping beside thee,</p>
<p class="verse">No need of pillow;</p>
<p class="verse">Thine arm and mine arm,</p>
<p class="verse6">Pillows are they.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">This being alternative to the method sometimes
adopted of literal unrhythmical translation, I hope
occasional licence will be condoned. This is what I
might have written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Lord-and-master (or Thee)-with-sleep-when,</p>
<p class="verse">Pillow-indeed-no-go-;</p>
<p class="verse">Mutual-different-of</p>
<p class="verse">Honourable-Arm-Pillow.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">To be quite literal is to be crudely unintelligible; the
absence of all gender, number, and person makes
certain interpolations inevitable. At the same time,
the translator must take for his unvarying motto
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sancta simplicitas</i>.</p>

<p>Love, of course, inspires innumerable quatrains,
which fly from mouth to mouth, from geisha to gejo,
like butterflies from one blossom to another. Sometimes
it is the man who speaks, as in the following:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Snow Song.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Careless of snow-drifts,</p>
<p class="verse">Nightly I seek thee;</p>
<p class="verse">Deeper the love lies,</p>
<p class="verse6">Heaped in my heart.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">More often the woman, who does not allow her sense
of humour to be atrophied by passion. But perhaps
the humour is quite unconscious in this description of</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Lovers Meeting.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">So much to talk of!</p>
<p class="verse">Yet for joy weeping,</p>
<p class="verse">Words, when we meet, fall</p>
<p class="verse6">Head over heels.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Bodily beauty is, of course, particularly fascinating to
a race which cannot be pronounced less susceptible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
its charm than those European peoples&mdash;Greek,
Italian, French&mdash;whose feeling for line and colour is
reckoned a superiority in them to their Northern
neighbours. Yet the panegyric of his mistress’s hair
or eyes or bosom is entirely banished from even
vulgar songs. Innate refinement rather than cold
indifference is probably the cause. The tree of the
spirit is preferred to the fruit and flowerage of the
flesh. Yet one seems to detect a flavour of apology
in this:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Confession.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Stylish appearance</p>
<p class="verse">Does not bewitch me;</p>
<p class="verse">Fruits pass, and flowers:</p>
<p class="verse6">I love the tree.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The Japanese word <em>ki</em> signifies both “tree” and
“spirit.” Quite commonplace, I own, is the consolation
afforded by some lines engraven on a toothpick,
but how many almond-eyed maidens visiting the
tea-house which thus combined mental with carnal
refreshment have tittered to read them!</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Consolation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">In mine ears linger</p>
<p class="verse">Words said at parting;</p>
<p class="verse">Sleeping alone, I</p>
<p class="verse6">Hope for a dream.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Rather quaint is the following lament over conjugal
incompatibility. But the wife knows that she must
submit, on pain of divorce; and the word <em>kigane</em>,
which I have rendered “trouble,” is used of little
inevitable domestic worries. The terms “fire-nature”
and “water-nature” are taken from Chinese
philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Incompatibility.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Thou, cold as water,</p>
<p class="verse">I, hot as fire;</p>
<p class="verse">Till we to earth turn,</p>
<p class="verse6">Trouble is mine.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Mathematicians who revel in romance of the fourth
dimension will note with pleasure this little sum in
amorous arithmetic:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Addition.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Longing to meet thee,</p>
<p class="verse">Longing to see thee,</p>
<p class="verse">Six and four inches,</p>
<p class="verse6">Passion’s a-foot!</p>
</div></div>

<p>The exact translation being&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Longing to meet, six inches,</p>
<p class="verse">Longing to see, four inches,</p>
<p class="verse">These, indeed, being added together,</p>
<p class="verse6">Make a <em>shaku</em>.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The word <em>shaku</em> has two meanings: (1) a linear foot;
(2) a woman’s hysterical desire. Ten inches go to a
Japanese foot.</p>

<p>The separation of lovers is a fruitful topic. I select
three poems which treat of it in divergent but equally
piquant manners. The first might be called&mdash;</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Amantium Iræ.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Would that my heart were</p>
<p class="verse">Cut out and shown thee!</p>
<p class="verse">Quarrelling leaves me</p>
<p class="verse6">Deeper in love.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The second contains a hint of that fondness for trees
and flowers which permeates all classes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Among the Pines.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">If, from thee sundered,</p>
<p class="verse">I roam the pine-wood,</p>
<p class="verse">Can it be dew falls?</p>
<p class="verse6">Can it be tears?</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The third frames a pretty fancy:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Reflection.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Far from each other,</p>
<p class="verse">Yearning for union;</p>
<p class="verse">Good, were our faces</p>
<p class="verse6">Glassed in the moon!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then it should be remarked that the wife figures as
frequently as the sweetheart in this lyrical woodland,
vocal with twittering sentiment. The European has
been so long accustomed to regard romance as the
province of young men and maidens, led through three
volumes or five acts to the altar, that married life is
either prosaic or only to be made interesting by a
breach of the Seventh Commandment. More than
ever does he presume that this convention must apply
to domestic life in the East, for he has always been
informed that there a girl must stifle the instincts of
her heart and pass submissively from her father’s to
her mother-in-law’s yoke. As the French saw puts it,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fille on nous supprime, femme on nous opprime</i>. But
this reasoning fails to take into account two modifying
considerations. Custom is so tempered by practice
that an affectionate parent (his name is legion) would
not risk his daughter’s happiness by marrying her to
an odious or notoriously evil person. Japanolaters will
assert that no Japanese person can be odious unless
corrupted by Western influence. But this is nonsense.
What most makes for happy marriages is the strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
sense of duty and the loving disposition of a Japanese
girl. Neither husband nor wife regards the sexual
instinct, however veiled, as the corner-stone of partnership
for life. Obedience to parental wisdom is the first
stage, mutual politeness the second, devotion to children,
begotten or adopted, the third. From these
unselfish elements a high average of felicity is attained,
possibly even higher than elsewhere. However that
may be, the wife’s fidelity, jealousy, affection recur as
motives of popular poesy. That essentially feminine
quality which every bachelor has observed in some
otherwise perfect wife “wedded to a churl,” and of
which I can find no better definition than the following
verse affords, would seem common to both hemispheres:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Raison de Femme.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Dearer than kindness</p>
<p class="verse">Of those I love not</p>
<p class="verse">Is thine unkindness,</p>
<p class="verse6">Loved one, to me.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This degrading and doglike devotion explains the
joy in service which robs it of all sting. Take this
revolting picture, which I christen</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Contented.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Gladly on love’s road</p>
<p class="verse">Pulling the rickshaw,</p>
<p class="verse">Undrawn, I draw it</p>
<p class="verse6">On to the end.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The husband (selfish brute!) is of course seated in
the rickshaw, and it is worth notice that “love’s road”
is the first metaphor we have encountered. Against
the jealous wife, bending, lantern in hand, over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
faithless lord, may be set this quiet tribute of grateful
security:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">My Husband.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Thou art as yonder</p>
<p class="verse">Delicate hill-pine,</p>
<p class="verse">Through years a thousand</p>
<p class="verse6">Ever the same.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It would not occur to a Tōkyō editor to invite his
readers in the silly season to answer the question,
“Have women a sense of humour?” But, if it did,
such quatrains as follow might convince him that they
have:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Warning.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">I am my master’s</p>
<p class="verse">Single-flowered cherry;</p>
<p class="verse">Folk seeking blossom</p>
<p class="verse6">Bend no boughs here.</p>
</div></div>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Waiting.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">All night I waited,</p>
<p class="verse">Yet my lord came not;</p>
<p class="verse">None but the moon came</p>
<p class="verse6">Under my net.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The <em>kaya</em> (mosquito-net) is not a mere curtain, but a
green gauze room within a room, suspended from the
corners of the ceiling.</p>

<p>Humour has indeed discharged thousands of these
pretty pellets, which lend themselves admirably to
satire, drollery, and play on words. Yet these are
precisely the most difficult to render. A jest, of
which the point depends on punning ambiguity, should
never cross the frontier. When a foreigner has been
made to see the quaint conjunction of incongruous
ideas, he will yet miss the surprise attending identity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of sound, which strikes with comic duplicity a native
ear. Moreover, the Japanese looks for verbal legerdemain
in his most serious literature with an appreciation
that seems puerile to us, who relegate puns and riddles
to half-educated minds. There is an equally large
field of fun which can only be indicated, since British
prudery plants it round with fig-trees. The Japanese,
like the French, see no harm in tipping Apollo’s arrows
with malicious mirth to assail humanity in the arms of
Venus, where it cuts a vulnerable and often ridiculous
figure. The Anglo-Saxon professes to exclude comedy
from the bedroom. He gains in dignity; he loses in
gaiety. If this same comedy, banished to the smoking-room,
descend to too gross levels, he has only to cross
the Channel and will find at the Palais Royal or elsewhere
such traps for laughter as Shakespeare and
Aristophanes did not disdain to set. He supposes
that the interests of morality require many drags on
the wheels of humour. He is generally sincere: the
restraint is not imposed by “hypocrisy,” as foreigners
believe and assert. But neither is the opposite
assumption justified, that races which permit themselves
more joyous licence are less virtuous than our
own. On the contrary, they find in laughter a safety-valve
sanctioned by custom. And it seems to me that
Madame and Okamisan, who are free to giggle behind
their fans at audacious pleasantry, are placed by
destiny in a more fortunate attitude than the British
matron, who is reduced to indignation or discomfort.
Critics of Japanese poems, novels, and plays usually
dismiss this element of mirth with the adjective
“pornographic,” but the epithet (if it presuppose an
ignobly prostituted pen) entirely misses the mark.
The passages so labelled do not allure readers with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the promise of forbidden fruit: they merely denote a
wider range of innoxious merriment, indulged in by a
nation whose sense of humour is as yet unfettered by
our local and artificial sense of propriety. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i>
of such songs is proved by the fact that they hardly
ever sound a cynical note. The tone of the only one
which I shall quote is exceptional:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Lothario.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Steered with deft rudder,</p>
<p class="verse">Fooled with soft speeches,</p>
<p class="verse">To my verandah</p>
<p class="verse6">I hale her up.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">But this song may have the opposite meaning of a
woman alluring a man with soft speeches. As there
are no pronouns and no genders in the vernacular, the
sense is entirely ambiguous, and the Japanese whom
I have consulted do not agree. So I append the
original:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Shita go kaji toru</p>
<p class="verse">Ano kuchiguruma</p>
<p class="verse">Noshite nikai</p>
<p class="verse6">Hiki-ageru.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>A fragrant anthology might be compiled of Dodoitsu
written in praise of flowers. There is certainly no
other country where flowers are so universally loved.
The humblest cottager will place in the <em>tokonoma</em> (an
alcove with slightly raised daïs) of his living room an
iris, a spray of plum-blossom, or a liliputian tree.
The noble will devote years of patient cultivation to
the production of a chrysanthemum more variegated
in colour and shape than those of his neighbour.
Wistaria, lotus, convolvulus, and azalea vie with the
cherry-blossom in attracting sightseers, who come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
crowds to feast their eyes on garden or pond. The
arts of flower-arrangement and landscape-gardening
may be looked upon as branches of science and philosophy;
at least, they command as much veneration.
Inevitably, then, is the minstrel’s lyre enwreathed with
innumerable garlands. Yet, possibly because of the
“pathetic fallacy,” which so constantly pervades similar
parterres of English poesy that its absence makes the
Japanese flower-plot seem scentless, the fancies which
find expression in this class of subject appear particularly
trivial. Sometimes a personal preference is
stated, as in</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">White Peony.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Full of set flowers,</p>
<p class="verse">Full is my chamber;</p>
<p class="verse">Thou art most stately,</p>
<p class="verse6">White peony.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes the cut blossom is commiserated, as in</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Adrift.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Ah! how my petals</p>
<p class="verse">Float in the flower-vase;</p>
<p class="verse">Helpless and rootless;</p>
<p class="verse6">Sad is my lot.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes the operation of a natural law, to which
plants as well as other forms of life are subject,
points a moral:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Death, the Leveller.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Peonies, roses,</p>
<p class="verse">Faded, are equal;</p>
<p class="verse">Only while life blooms</p>
<p class="verse6">Differ the flowers.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">But human egoism, which only sees in nature a background<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to its own existence, has not stained with drops
of romantic blood these pale flowerets. No Japanese
poet would conceive such a stanza as that in “Maud”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“There has fallen a splendid tear</p>
<p class="verse">From the passion-flower at the gate;</p>
<p class="verse">The larkspur listens ‘I hear,’ ‘I hear’;</p>
<p class="verse">And the lily whispers, ‘I wait.’”</p>

<p class="noindent">He knows that the Great Mother has other cares
more absorbing than the love-sick suspense of a
whining suitor, that the myriad marriages of bird and
beast and blossom are perhaps as much or as little to
her as the predilections of Maud. He would enjoy
Professor Huxley’s rap at the singers who “mistake
their sensual caterwauling for the music of the spheres,”
and his pedestrian fancy would shudder at the unchartered
imagination of Tennyson.</p>

<p>Buddhist doctrines have so profoundly influenced
thought and feeling, that thousands of little songs rise
daily like prayers of intercession or gratitude to the
Lord Buddha. But these would demand a volume of
explanation, which I am not competent to write. I
select one playful and one serious poem, having reference
to religious ideas. The first might be called</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Extravagance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Joy drew the rickshaw,</p>
<p class="verse">Heaven takes vengeance,</p>
<p class="verse">Empty the larder,</p>
<p class="verse6">Rickshaw of fire.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This may be expanded into: “We drove about in a
rickshaw, enjoying ourselves; we spent all our money;
we are punished by Heaven, for we suffer remorse,
like the sinners, who are pulled in fiery rickshaws by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
avenging devils in hell.” Such engaging pictures of
a future state are often exhibited at temple <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i>, and
serve to stimulate liberality on the part of worshippers.
Quite philosophic is the pessimism of</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Occasion.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">For the moon, cloud-wrack;</p>
<p class="verse">For the flower, tempest;</p>
<p class="verse">For the truth, <em>this</em> world;</p>
<p class="verse6">Wanting the hour.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">I translate <em>ukiyo</em> by “<em>this</em> world”: the more scrupulous
dictionary renders it by “this fleeting or miserable
world, so full of vicissitudes and unsettled.”
For the “vale of tears” is not a Christian concept
only: Mrs. Gummidge was also a Buddhist without
knowing it. It is curious that this theological term,
with its disparaging connotation, was affixed to the
modern popular school of painters, among whom
Hokusai is the best known, because they descended
from lofty, conventional subjects to the life of workaday
folk. The central thought of the poem, however,
narrowed to a romantic application, recalls a line by
Browning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Never the time and place, and the loved one altogether.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Writers of Dodoitsu have this advantage over versifiers
who employ more classical metres, that they are
not forced by convention to repeat stereotyped fancies,
but are at liberty to invent new ones. The balloon,
the camera, the locomotive, may take the place of
dragon, stork, and phœnix. This pouring of foreign
wine into native bottles produces a quaint blend. A
girl thus reproaches her lover with</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Inconstancy.</p>

<p class="verse">Fuel to engine;</p>
<p class="verse">Thy heart an air-ship</p>
<p class="verse6">Loose in the sky.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Here the similes are plain and forcible. The next
poem is less lucid:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Despair.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Borne in no road-car,</p>
<p class="verse">Endless the railway,</p>
<p class="verse">How shall poor I reach</p>
<p class="verse6">Station at last?</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Literally: “Riding in no vehicle (which is used for
a short journey), the train whithersoever going (for an
indefinite distance), by doing what shall this body of
mine, Terminus?” That is: My love is not a short-lived
fancy, but a lifelong passion, until I reach the
terminus of death. Graceful, indeed, but scarcely
gracious is a lady’s reply to an admirer who had sent
her his photograph:</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">The Higher Photography.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Only your likeness!</p>
<p class="verse">Faithful? I know not.</p>
<p class="verse">Could I but take one,</p>
<p class="verse6">Too, of your heart!</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The double meaning of a “faithful” likeness and a
“faithful” lover can, for once, be preserved in English.
A pun on the word <em>tokeru</em>, which means “to melt”
and “to be undone,” is allied with a dainty antithesis
in</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">Dissolution.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <em>shimada</em> is perhaps the most elaborate, and
certainly the most elegant, way of dressing the hair.
It is generally adopted by geisha and young married
women, dividing favour with the <em>chōchō</em> or butterfly
coiffure. Respect for age is counselled in a rather
pathetic protest by an old woman, who recalls her
faded beauty in a conventional image. Nightingales
and plum-trees are always associated in Japanese
minds.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <em>umeboshi</em>, a plum pickled in salt and <em>shiso</em> and
afterwards dried, is as happily descriptive of the
wizened monkey face of a Japanese crone as the peach
of an Anglo-Saxon lassie’s complexion. It will be
seen that serio-comic touches of self-depreciation, like
the old lady’s frank comparison of faded bloom to
dried fruit, do not jar on the Japanese. Sincerity&mdash;genuine
feeling and just appreciation&mdash;is at the root
of their poetic impulse. Why should a disappointed
girl shrink from whispering her secret to the reeds of
anonymous minstrelsy?</p>

<p>From the foregoing thirty Dodoitsu the reader can
form a not inadequate opinion of “ditties sung by
singing-girls to the twanging of the guitar.” That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>accidental glamour, which constitutes style and makes
of one word a queen, of another a beggar-maid, through
vicissitudes of usage, does not emanate from one of
them. They are marred for a native ear by domestic
and colloquial idiom, “soiled by all ignoble use”; they
treat too often of sexual sentiment, which our literary
verse parades to satiety, and which theirs rather
shrouds in dignified silence. No doubt you will find
among Tanka and Haikai more ingenuity of thought,
more dexterity of pen. But, putting that aside, the
Dodoitsu has more interest for a humanist, since its
range of feeling is wider. Just as the street-scenes of
Hokusai and the love-scenes of Utamaro afford more
humane pleasure than the purely artistic studies of
their academic precursors, so we are less allured by
“A Fan in my Lady’s Chamber,” by “A Distant
View of a Fishing Boat,” by “Hoar-frost on the
Bamboos,” than by the artless outcries of else inarticulate
nature. The blue-stocking at court, who finds it
so easy to turn a polished compliment, is more remote
from our hearts than her humble sister, doing rough
work in the rice-field. The sorrows of wife and maid,
the joy of flowers and laughter&mdash;these inspire in us
deeper sympathy than the experimental literature of
dilettante dames. There is often a crude spontaneity
in the non-literary poem which is more pleasing than
a recondite conceit. But, however crude the expression
may be, it yet owes something to form. The
poet is obliged to satisfy the easy metrical conditions
which regulate the structure of a Dodoitsu, thus ensuring
a neat circlet for a single gem, whether it be
paste or diamond. How clumsy a Japanese song can
become, when the Muse has forgotten her corset, may
be seen by the following effusion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Mukōjima,</p>
<p class="verse">Cherry-blossom,</p>
<p class="verse">Sliced dumpling,</p>
<p class="verse">Boiled eggs,</p>
<p class="verse">Girl, come here!</p>
<p class="verse">Drinking, sleeping,</p>
<p class="verse">Heigh-ho! Tra-la-la!”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This is neither poetry nor literature. It reminds one
of the primitive war-song, which Mr. Aston quotes in
his “History of Japanese Literature” as being sung
by the Imperial Guards:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Ho! now is the time;</p>
<p class="verse">Ho! now is the time;</p>
<p class="verse">Ha! Ha! Psha!</p>
<p class="verse">Even now</p>
<p class="verse">My boys!</p>
<p class="verse">Even now</p>
<p class="verse">My boys!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>In conclusion, let me say that an exhaustive study
of Dodoitsu would assuredly yield richer results than
the writer has been able to obtain by the casual
gleaning of such songs as fell in his way from the
lips of geisha or student.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent">In a large enclosure behind one of the smaller Shiba
temples on a burning 1st of July sat a perspiring
crowd of men and boys, whose attitude of joyful and
critical attention strangely revived memories of a great
match at Lord’s or the Oval. Yet the trial of strength
which was provoking similar enthusiasm presented a
very different spectacle. Instead of the green pitch, a
sanded ring formed the arena; instead of twenty-two
lithe cricketers, clad in white flannels and protected by
glove and pad from dangerous balls, a band of twenty-two
wrestlers, enormous and bloated, with no clothing
but a garish loin-cloth and no protection but their own
skill, awaited the umpire’s word to begin. He, too,
bore little likeness to the straw-hatted oracle in a
milkman’s coat, whose vigilant silence is unbroken but
for occasional appeals from bowler or batsman. His
<em>kimono</em> was of grey silk, his sash embroidered with
gold, his short cape of black silk with brightly coloured
clasp; and, as he gave the signal with his fan, or
directed the combatants with excited insistence, hopping
and crying on the flanks of the panting giants, he
resembled some gorgeous gadfly goading two buffaloes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to the fray. Nothing could be less Japanese than the
build and bulk of the wrestlers. They seemed men of
another race, Maoris or Patagonians, with their huge
naked limbs and long hair, drawn forward in a queue to
the middle of the head or falling loose on the shoulders.
Before entering the ring each would carefully adjust
his apron and bind his hair as coquettishly as possible,
for, hideous though they appear to us, these monsters
of fat and muscle are the darlings of every schoolboy,
enjoying a popularity as fervent as that of “W. G.” or
Prince “Ranji.” Their names, their records, their
chances of success are on every tongue.</p>

<p>The bouts are more interesting to watch than any I
had seen elsewhere, for attack and defence were more
various. The conqueror might win by other methods
than by bringing his opponent to the ground: if he
could hurl or hustle him outside the ring, victory was
his. The rules are said to authorise forty-eight falls&mdash;twelve
throws, twelve lifts, twelve twists, and twelve
throws over the back. To avoid being pinned down
or pitched out, the smaller men must exercise extraordinary
agility, and loud was the shouting when
Goliath fell victim to a scientific ruse. It happened
sometimes that the men lost their tempers; spitting,
slapping, taunting would precede more legitimate sport:
then indeed it was good to hear the bystanders’
Homeric laughter, which soon recalled the heroes to
their higher selves. I will confess that these indecorous
interludes were partly due to a mischievous American,
who primed his favourites with praise and whisky.
As the afternoon wore on, the heat became intolerable,
but, fired with professional ambition, Dares succeeded
Entellus, while cheap coloured portraits of the competitors
found ready sale and the overcrowded enclosure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
reeked of sweat and sand. At length the final bout
was announced. Each side chose a champion, whose
laurels were difficult to gain, for three rivals must be
worsted in continuous struggle by the prize-winner.
Before the end was reached my patience had been
exhausted. On a degenerate descendant of the fighting
Anglo-Saxon breed this barbarous exhibition of
brute locked with brute began to pall. Besides, the
tropical atmosphere, which from that day forward
made dress a weariness and sleep impossible, pleaded
more eloquently than any argument how wise it were
to seek less fiery pleasures. I resolved to leave Tōkyō
the following day and take the waters of some mountain-spa,
remote from wrestlers and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>At an altitude of nearly three thousand feet on the
north-eastern slope of Mount Haruna, an extinct volcano,
stands the picturesque village of Ikao. Half
the houses are hotels and most have balconies, which
command a view of the Tonegawa Valley and sublime
Akagi San. The main street climbs from terrace to
terrace, a natural staircase, between châlets equipped
with bamboo pipes, through which the hot yellow
water pours incessantly. Proximity to the capital
makes this health resort very popular, yet access is not
altogether easy. After five hours’ train to Mayebashi,
another five hours are required of rather rough rickshaw
travelling: at one point the Tonegawa must be crossed
by means of a rope ferry; at others the traveller must
dismount, so steep is the road. Yet he will be well
rewarded at his journey’s end by a panorama of rare
extent and beauty. Behind him, and eighteen hundred
feet above, soars Soma-yama, from which the summit
of Fuji is just visible; opposite stretch the Mikuni and
Nikkō ranges; at his feet are wooded valleys and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
foaming torrents. The Kindayu Hotel, under most
courteous and capable management, combines two
great advantages. It supplies the foreigner with such
food and general comfort as his habits generally render
indispensable; at the same time, it accommodates so
many Japanese of all classes, that exceptional opportunities
are afforded of becoming more intimately
acquainted with the latter than would be possible in
their own homes, where various duties and claims
absorb their time. Here they seek only health and
pleasure: no obstacle but the easily surmounted barrier
of language hinders mutually delightful intercourse.
At least, the writer formed more friendships and
obtained more glimpses of native life during a month
at Ikao than at any other period of his stay in the
country.</p>

<p>Bathing is, of course, the centre round which
existence revolves. Half-a-dozen small baths, fitted
with hot and cold water, that the temperature may be
modified to suit each bather, enable the stranger to
bathe in the solitude he prefers. But more than two
dozen others, in which from three to thirteen people
can bathe together, are more characteristic of the
place. The largest has a hot douche, and the temperature
is often as high as 115° Fahrenheit. Here
the native guests return two or three times a day to
soak and to gossip. In this <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">al fresco</i> salon laughter
reigns and conversation flows as freely as the water.
Surprised indeed would the bathers be to learn that
a costume is deemed essential by more prurient races,
whose artificial manners divorce simplicity from
decency. Yet Western prudery is beginning to corrupt
the upper classes, who tend to convert these
social gatherings into family parties, without going so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
far as to adopt a bathing-dress. The water is rather
turbid and yellow. It contains iron and sulphate of
soda. Most of the patients suffer from rheumatism or
barrenness, and look on a course of treatment as a
sovereign remedy. Some also drink of the mineral
spring which lies at the end of the Yusawa ravine,
where seats and swings line a well-shaded avenue.
Probably they derive more benefit from the pleasant
promenade than the unpleasant beverage.</p>

<p>The first friend I made was a silk merchant and a
poet. I shall call him Yamada San. I had gone one
day a few hundred yards down the precipitous path
leading to Shibukawa, when my attention was arrested
by a very pretty tableau. To the left of the road lay
a lute-shaped pond, traversed by little bridges and
dotted with islands on which stone lanterns and
wooden shrines proclaimed the owner’s piety. The
deeper end of the lakelet was overshadowed by a
balcony, on which sat two serious young men with rod
and line, while a daintily-dressed girl reclining beside
them was preparing bait&mdash;that is, crumbling a soft
bread-cake with delicate fingers. The fish seemed
wary, and I remarked one astute leviathan among
gold-fish that succeeded in snatching the bait and
swimming away with an impudent cock of the tail that
would have exasperated a less patient angler. Remarking
my interest, the fishermen politely invited
me to join them; and then I discovered two curious
features of this gentle angling&mdash;its cheapness and its
humanity. The proprietor was willing to provide all
accessories and implements for three-farthings, on one
condition: any fish which had the imprudence to be
hooked must be tenderly replaced in the water. Thus
he reconciled Buddhistic kindness to animals with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
encouragement of sport, and the fish obtained a maximum
of food with a minimum of risk. It seemed that
Yamada San was also staying at Kindayu’s. We
therefore returned together, while O Mitsu, his charming
child-wife, walked submissively behind. Woven
silk filled his business hours, but woven sentiments
his leisure. Before the hotel was reached he confided
to me the poem which had just germinated in his
mind that afternoon. He had really been fishing for
fancies.</p>

<p class="verse">Faintly between escapes from afar the voice of the roebuck.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">As he understood a little English, I conferred on him
this brace of hexameters. He was naturally astonished
by such long lines, but, as his Tanka contained thirty-one
syllables and my translation only thirty, we had
both expressed the same ideas in about the same
space. Exchange of verses was followed by exchange
of presents. In the evening I received a large cake
with Yamada San’s compliments. Then came my
first unconscious lapse from etiquette. In the hope
of pleasing both husband and wife, I presented
O Mitsu with a quaintly carven <em>kanzashi</em>, an ornamental
hair-pin; but, though she did not seem displeased,
the poet thanked me with a cold, disapproving
air. At a later stage he explained how improper it
was considered to pay the least attention to a married
woman. I apologised, and he went on to explain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
love-marriages were becoming the rule and not the
exception, and that among his friends few matches
were now arranged without consulting the wishes of
the two most concerned. However, O Mitsu was
permitted to play to me on her <em>koto</em>, and to condone
my indiscretion with the parting gift of a much-cherished
fan, on which was inscribed a famous poem
by Tsuma to the following effect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Though I may sing of the beautiful garments of beautiful women,</p>
<p class="verse">Dearer to me are the pines of Japan and the cherries in blossom.</p>
</div></div>

<p>By this engaging couple I was initiated into a novel
game, played with flower cards, <em>Hana-Karuta</em>. The
pack consists of forty-eight pieces, each three inches
by two, and of twelve suits, Moon, Rain, Iris, Clover,
Cherry-blossom, Maple-leaf, Wistaria, Chrysanthemum,
Pine, Peony, Plum, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paulownia Imperialis</i>. The
four cards of each suit are worth 1, 5, 10, and 20
points respectively. The player may only draw a
card from the pool if he have one of the same suit in
his hand. Failing this, he must enrich the pool by
one of his cards when his turn comes to draw. Each
pair, when made, is laid on the table, and when the
pack is exhausted the player who has scored most
points is declared winner. This very simple game
had much vogue in Ikao, but when the party included
no ladies the more difficult <em>Go-Ban</em> was more
popular. Like all his countrymen, Yamada San was
a rapid draughtsman, and would often, when appealed
to for information on historical or religious matters,
illustrate his meaning by clever sketches. Of these I
retain two excellent specimens: a drawing of Yoshitsune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in elaborate armour and a long-nosed <em>tengu</em>, or
mountain-goblin, which has many characteristics in
common with the Scandinavian <em>trold</em>. Unfortunately,
our acquaintance was limited to three days, for at the
end of that time business recalled the poet to Ashikaga,
but he exacted a promise that I would pay a
visit to that interesting town, given up to cotton and
Confucius.</p>

<p>As if to console me on the evening of this departure,
the kindly Kindayu family invited all their guests
to a performance given by three local geisha in the
principal room of the hotel. The chief musician was
a masculine-looking woman of fifty, who thrummed a
<em>kokyu</em>, or three-stringed fiddle, and broke in on the
recitative of her young companions at unexpected
moments with peculiar growls and sharp cries as
of an animal in agony. When the narrative of the
soloist took a tragic turn, these inhuman noises were
so distressing that, without following the story, I
experienced acute pain, while my neighbours of the
more sympathetic sex were actually in tears. Had
my musical education been more advanced, I should
have realised that these were no singers of light
Dodoitsu, but exponents of a far loftier type of entertainment,
the <em>Gedayu</em> or musical drama. It originated
in the middle of the seventeenth century, and is
sometimes called <em>Jōruri</em> after a heroine of that name,
whose tragic love for Yoshitsune is a favourite theme
of composers. In fact, the geisha on this occasion
were usurping the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of <em>Jōruri-katari</em> or dramatic
reciters, whose chanted recitative formed the nucleus,
first, of the marionette theatre, and, later, of the
popular theatre, when dialogue and scenic art were
superadded. In the absence of either human or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
wooden dolls, a most lugubrious effect was produced.
At last, to my relief, a male performer, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pince-sans-rire</i>,
whose dry humour and staccato diction stamped
him of the tribe of Grossmith, transformed the
audience from weeping Niobes to effigies of mirth.
In vain the polite little ladies tried to smother their
smiles behind their raised <em>kimono</em> sleeves: as the
song proceeded they were vanquished by fits of
laughter, and shook helplessly on their cushions. I
possessed but one cue to this infectious merriment
in the constantly recurring word <em>emma</em>, which on the
lips of Mr. Dan Leno would have assuredly referred
to his wife or his mother-in-law, those patient butts of
music-hall humour, but which would only mean for
Japanese ears the Buddhist Rhadamanthus, who pronounces
sentence on all who enter hell. Considerably
mystified, I turned to Tanaka Okusama, another
visitor from Ashikaga, and inquired if “the honourable
singer were really singing about hell-things.” He
was. The song was an amusing but irreverent pastiche
of social satire. It described the arrival in
Hades of the bad judge, the cheating merchant, the
false singing-girl; their confession and appropriate
punishment. Again I missed the marionettes, for
their presence would have recalled an exactly similar
treatment of the same theme in a Montmartre puppet-show.
And I remembered how the Parisian populace
joined delightedly in the cry of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A la chaudière!</span>” as
the mimic devil chased lawyer and cocotte into a
Punch-and-Judy Inferno. It was the mystery play of
the Middle Ages, surviving as a crude comedy for the
ignorant poor&mdash;a rough travesty of the theology in
which their more instructed superiors still affect to
believe.</p>

<p>In the course of the next fortnight I became well
acquainted with Tanaka Okusama, and through her
with many others. She was a most intelligent,
capable woman, who conducted one business while
her husband had charge of another, grain and rice
being the commodities in which they dealt. She
considered herself middle-aged at the age of thirty-two,
wore therefore most sombre colours, and was
the mother of six boys, two of whom joined her at
Ikao. Her explanation of the <em>emma</em> song was followed
by an avowal of religious disbelief. She was
neither a Buddhist nor a Shintōist, but believed that
the priests taught old wives’ fables, and for her own
part concentrated her mind on her business and her
family. A free-thinking Japanese woman was a novel
phenomenon to me then, though I have since met
several. The fragments of Western history which
she had acquired were also interesting items in her
conversation. Plied with questions about English
sights and customs, I was also asked to give an
opinion on Cæsar, Napoleon, and Epaminondas.
What I recalled of the last hero was so shadowy that
I felt inclined to parody the Oxford undergraduate’s
evasive reply: “About Epaminondas little is known,
but it may safely be assumed that, as he lived, so
he died.” However, Tanaka Okusama knew more
than that about him, for she had just been reading
“Keikoku Bidan,” a popular novel by Yano Fumiō,
who is supposed to have selected Theban politics for
his subject, that he might administer useful lessons to
his compatriots. I suspected that novel-reading was
the source of most of the lady’s knowledge. Indeed,
she disclaimed all pretension to the title of blue-stocking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Continual tea-parties in my room or hers, though
very educational, were marred for one of us by two
circumstances&mdash;the familiarity of servants and the
uncertainty of time. Democratic in sympathy, preferring
the expansiveness of the simple to the discreet
inanity of the genteel, I was yet a little surprised
to remark the ultra-friendly relations between servant
and guest. A “boy” would enter with profound
obeisance, deliver a message or an article demanded,
and, being invited to join the party, would play cards,
ask and be asked very personal questions, make himself
thoroughly at home, and depart when duty called,
bowing low. At first it is difficult not to associate
these prostrations with subservience, but they really
imply nothing but good manners. When the guest
left the hotel, he would hand the “boy” a tip,
wrapped in paper, as etiquette requires, for that delicacy
which impels us to concede intimacy and refuse
money, or to refuse intimacy and concede money to
social inferiors, because the conjunction of the two
offends our sense of the deference due to class-distinctions,
would appear strange to the far more rigidly
classified Japanese. In fact, more real democracy&mdash;if
by that be meant frank and unembarrassed intercourse
between high and low&mdash;is possible under a caste
system than any other. Every one “knows his place,”
and has no inducement to affect a higher rank than he
really possesses by an assumption of haughty manners.
The innate courtesy of most Japanese servants renders
friendship with them more delightful than might be
supposed, but occasionally one comes across a conceited,
half-educated fellow in European dress, who
passes from familiarity to impertinence. However, I
was soon taught a more difficult lesson than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
forgetting class prejudice. Perhaps the hardest of all
truths engrained in Oriental theory and conduct is the
unimportance of time. We, who live by machinery
which measures for most men the hours of work, the
hours of play, until life becomes a time-table and the
heart a chronometer, are absolutely incapable of indifference
to Time’s tyranny. When I proffered or
accepted an invitation, nothing amused these hospitable
lotus-eaters so much as my natural bias towards
punctuality. What did it matter? The morning, if I
liked, or the afternoon, or the evening: time was made
for man, not man for time. Accordingly, if I paid a
promised call and became the involuntary witness of a
toilette, a meal, or a siesta, I had merely to withdraw
and call again. If my guests did not arrive at the prescribed
hour, they would come some hours later, or
even sooner, or not at all. At first I was so put out
by these vagaries and so fearful of intruding, that it
took message after message to draw me from my own
society or that of a book. But gradually I realised
that in this happy country offence was not readily
given or taken; that time was a negligible convention;
that to follow the impulse of the moment was
wiser than to ape the precision of a clock. I have
heard the British trader exclaim in Japan, “They can
never become a great nation; they are so unbusinesslike!”
and I sympathised with his horror of Eastern
nonchalance, but I doubt his conclusion. Merchants
in Russia are just as dilatory. Yet either country can
count on promptitude in military or political exigency.
What commerce loses in time it gains to some extent
through restrictions imposed on foreign rivalry. In
any case, as they emerge from feudal to industrial conditions
those indolent races will be forced by the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of self-defence to quicken the pace. As for me, I
resolved to ignore my watch and rely on Zaburo
Tanaka.</p>

<p>Zaburo was a bright-eyed schoolboy of ten. Close-shaven
and bare-footed, he raced from wing to wing
of the hotel in a single cotton garment with cheerful
impetuosity. At breakfast I would hear him on a
balcony fifty yards away reading aloud in that monotonous
sing-song which his countrymen adopt, even in
trains, without evoking a protest from fellow-travellers.
At first I imagined him to be reciting prayers, but this
supposition was erroneous. Two or three times a day
his knock would rattle on my sliding-door and a loud
summons would entreat Edoardo San to keep him
company. When his mother was occupied with private
cares, he would obtain leave to visit with me the
Benten-daki, and as we watched the tumbling terror
of that lovely waterfall, sparkling against green boughs,
I was the recipient of many schoolboy confidences.
His great ambition was to fight for the Mikado; his
accounts of school life were tinged with military
ardour. The elder boys had guns and knapsacks of
fur; in the summer boys and masters camped out
together; his intimate friend, Rokutaro, had lost an
elder brother in the war with China, and the others
were quite envious of that funereal privilege. He
remembered one verse of a song which his school-fellows
were fond of singing, as they marched to the
drill-ground. The air was spirited, but the words
were more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> than ingenious, if the following stanza
be typical of the rest:</p>

<p>In the middle of July falls the Buddhist festival of
Bon, better known as the Feast of Lanterns, when
the souls of the dead revisit the living. The decay
of religion has unfortunately robbed this touching
celebration of its more striking features. Formerly
on the eve of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> the graves were hung with
lanterns, that the spirits might be lighted on the way
to their old homes. On the day itself the villagers
fasted, but left before the household shrine flowers and
water and a little food, while they went out towards
evening and danced in a large circle, singing quaint
songs and clapping their hands to the strains of drum
and flute. Then, when the time was come for the
spirits to return, on river and stream were launched a
fleet of tiny boats of straw, each with its paper lantern,
in which the invisible visitors were wafted back to
shadow-land. These things are done no more, or
only in remote rural districts. Danger to shipping
caused the floating of little fire-ships to be prohibited
in the ports, while at Tōkyō the ceremony of “opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the river” covers the Sumidagawa with gay pleasure-boats,
and in the secular crackle of fireworks the
sacred associations of the day are forgotten. In the
villages the peasants have not abandoned the dance,
which town-folk delegate to geisha, but its date varies
from district to district, and I did not witness one
until a month later at Akakura. Yet Ikao has contrived
to preserve the more pious aspect of All Souls’
Day by two simple services of devotion in graveyard
and temple.</p>

<p>By the merest accident I caught sight of a group
of women passing through a dark grove of cryptomeria,
whose lofty aisles are sown with innumerable
tombs. I had often been there, allured by the tranquil
images of Buddha, whose face and posture seemed
eloquent of everlasting repose. To-day their silent
watch was broken by the passage of many rustling
skirts and gentle laughter, for even in such places the
childish <em>musumé</em> does not deem it sinful to smile. I
struck across the wood and recognised the sister of my
landlord, Kindayu San, accompanied by three or four
serving-women. One carried a kettle of boiling water,
another some sticks of incense, and a third some
flowers. Permission being accorded to join them, I
went along with them to more than thirty graves.
On each a little water was poured, a little incense
burned, and the prayer, “Namu Amida Butsu,”
uttered. The humblest of the dead was equally
honoured with the nearest kinsman, and, after relations
by marriage or adoption had been visited, the
last to receive salutation was a <em>banto</em>, or temporary
bookkeeper, who had died four years before after
eight years’ service. “Will not the honourable
stranger also make a prayer?” was asked, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
complied, repeating “Namu Amida Butsu,” “I adore
thee, O Eternal Buddha,” in the hope that their god
would understand that his claim to adoration by barbarian
lips lay in the kind memorial offices which his
faith inspired. Many of the graves lay so far apart
that we had crossed two valleys and found ourselves
some miles from home at the luncheon-hour of noon.
So we entered the nearest tea-house and were served
with tea and sweet cakes. As the proprietor had a
small stock of sacred images for sale, I bought for a
souvenir of the day two clay foxes with tails gilded at
the tip, the snarling door-keepers of the rice-goddess;
but Inari must have rejected in anger my mock
homage, for three weeks later in a carefully packed
<em>yanagori</em> I grieved to find chaotic “fragments of no
more a” fox.</p>

<div class="caption">Personators of Jizō (Kiōgen).</div>
</div>

<p>That afternoon I remarked an unusual stir and
clatter of small feet below my balcony. Crowds of
children, on foot or slung behind the patient backs of
mother or elder sister, were making their way to the
large school-house, which stood a few yards beyond
and below the southern entrance of the hotel. It
being holiday time, I had never seen any of the
scholars, and the sole occupant of the spacious play-ground
was a weather-beaten stone effigy of Jizō in a
red cotton night-cap and yellow bib. This wet saint
(<em>nure-botoke</em>), as the Japanese laughingly call such
unhoused divinities, had always excited my sympathy,
for there he stood without his five companions’ society,
exposed to rain and wind, disregarded even by the
very infants whose patron saint he is considered to
be. At any rate, I could see no pious heap of pebbles
laid on his knees, though the neglectful little ones
would be glad enough, on reaching the dry bed of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>River of Souls, to seek refuge in his large <em>kimono</em>
sleeves, when mischievous demons should demolish
the pebble-heaps which it would be their duty to pile
up there as the penalty of childish faults. But
perhaps they were too busy playing to remember him
during the holidays, or perhaps they had unbelieving
teachers who connived at their neglect. I indulged
a faint hope that public expiation was to be made, and
that the toddling crowd would lay some tribute on his
faithful lap. But its destination was a temple situated
below the school-house, and as it swept merrily
by grotesque, deserted Jizō I fancied that the stone
features grew more rigid and grey beneath the cotton
night-cap, his consolatory proof of at least one worshipper.</p>

<p>Having set a few stones on his pedestal, I followed
the rest to a small temple, which was surrounded
by women and children. On a raised platform, which
formed the temple-floor, about a dozen priests, resplendently
robed, were moving in rotatory procession
and chanting passages of the Buddhist canon. The
babies were gazing open-eyed on the bright embroideries
of instruments and vestments, while as
many people as could be accommodated were allowed
to occupy mats at one extremity of the platform.
Among them a place was obligingly made for me,
and soon after I had taken my seat the priests also
sat down to listen to a discourse from a young and
eloquent preacher. I had been in many temples, and
watched the crowds making prostration, buying holy
knick-knacks, and flinging copper coins into the broad-barred
money-boxes, but this was the first sermon
I had the good fortune to hear. Continually reverting
to the theme, “Mina sekai no hito kiodai”&mdash;all beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in the universe are brothers&mdash;the orator spoke long and
earnestly of the unseen ties which bind the living and
the dead, of the infinite chords and scales of existence,
of the love and goodwill which no creature was too
humble to show or too lofty to accept. Sometimes
an old man groaned, and sometimes an urchin was
removed screaming, but most of the listeners remained
passive and stolid till the end. Then babies were
hoisted, farewell bows were exchanged, and the congregation
melted away. If you ask me why so many
children were present, I can only suppose that they
were attracted by the excitement of novelty. There
was none of the bustle and glare which make a <em>matsuri</em>,
the ordinary temple <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>, one glorious saturnalia of
piety and merriment, when theatres and booths, covered
with wonderful paper toys and every known variety
of sweetmeat, block the approaches to the sacred
building. In this the Buddhists greatly outshine their
more austere Shintōist rivals. Probably nine-tenths
of the peasants are in agreement with an old man
with whom I conversed after an impressive service
at Hommonji, the chief temple of the Nichiren sect.
As we descended the temple-steps I asked him
why he preferred Buddhism to other forms of faith.
“Because,” he answered, “it is more amusing.”</p>

<p>I was awakened the next morning by a peculiar
rocking sensation, as if my bed were a cradle swung
to and fro by invisible hands. Then I saw the
<em>obbasan</em>, an old woman who waited on the European
guests, rush, frightened and half-dressed, along the
verandah. It dawned on me that this must be a long-hoped-for
earthquake, and as the vibrations ceased
after some seconds, which naturally seemed of unusual
length, I was slightly disappointed. Residents say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that the fear of earthquake, unlike the fear of other
dangers, is increased rather than lessened by experience.
Certainly the Japanese themselves, in spite of
their fatalism, realise to the full the terrible penalty
of inhabiting a land of volcanoes. That day little else
was talked of. Two little girls, who had been adopted
by Kindayu San after losing their parents in the great
shock, followed by a tidal wave, some years before,
became objects of particular attention. Now, Ikao is
perched on the flank of a volcano, and the site of an
extinct crater is occupied by the beautiful Haruna
Lake, which I had not yet visited, so gladly I accepted
the proposal of Nitobe San to walk there. I had made
his acquaintance a few days previously on the archery-ground,
adjoining the hotel, where he displayed remarkable
skill in handling the unwieldy bow which is
still a popular and effective weapon in the hands of
Japanese archers. Indeed, he was only surpassed by
a <em>samurai</em> of about fifty, who hit the bull’s-eye four
times out of five. Yet his appearance was far more
studious than athletic, for Nitobe San attended the
medical school at the University of Tōkyō, and
when he pored over German text-books through gold-rimmed
spectacles had already the reassuring gravity
of a family doctor.</p>

<p>Our way lay first along the Yusawa ravine, but,
instead of continuing to the source of the mineral
spring, we ascended a steep and tortuous path to the
right, which at every turn disclosed new aspects of
the woods and valleys beneath. Often we would stop
to gather tiger-lilies or yellow roses, that shone like
golden stars in a sky of emerald foliage, for, except
where the carefully kept track wound in and out, the
mountain side was swathed in evergreen. Issuing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
length from the trees, we reached a grassy plateau, on
which is the grazing ground of the milch-cows that
supply Ikao. To the left is a curious conical hill,
known as the Haruna Fuji; and other masses of
irregular rock are partially covered with lichen, so as
to produce the effect of ruined castles half hidden by
clambering ivy. Indeed, my first impression was that
these were relics of feudal fortresses, until closer
inspection revealed the freakish cleverness of Nature.
Two miles of level walking brought us to the lake,
which is simply a large tarn surrounded by small
bosom-shaped hillocks at such regular intervals as to
repeat the irresistible suggestion of human ingenuity.
It might have been a giant’s silver shield embossed
upon the border with knobs of jade.</p>

<p>Gladly we rested at the tea-house on the margin, for
hot sun and loud cicada had been fatiguing eye and
ear. After lunch I took a bathe from the only boat to
be obtained, though its crazy, water-logged condition
left much to be desired. However, the boatman did
his best to remedy the deficiencies of his craft, and, as
I undressed, hung each garment in succession round
his neck, to prevent their being soiled and immersed,
as they otherwise certainly would have been. Much
refreshed, I persuaded my companion to extend our
walk to the ancient Shintō temple of Haruna, not
more than a mile and a half away. We climbed to the
top of Tenjin-toge, at which pass the road becomes
too narrow and precipitous for rickshaws, as it plunges
suddenly into a curiously imagined glen. Never had
I seen such bizarre configuration, such eccentric juxtaposition
of tree and stone. Pines darted like dragons
from the cliff; rocks started like mammoths from a
thicket, or lowered savagely across the torrent, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
raced or trickled below. It seemed as though the
spirits of water and wood and fire had suddenly
been petrified at the supreme moment of a great
triangular battle, and waited, weapon in hand, to spring
once more each at his adversary’s throat. Evidently
the old temple, dedicated to Ho-musubi, the god of
fire, and Haniyasu-hime, the goddess of earth, was
the citadel, defended and attacked by these weird
combatants. Towering cryptomeria stood on guard
around it, and huge rocks, tip-toe on tenuous bases,
attended the word of command to crush the curving
rafters. It needed but one signal from the imprisoned
fire-god, one movement of the volcanic earth-goddess,
to fill that fantastic glen with the clamour and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>
of primæval war. Elsewhere we might have admired
the carven serpents, that writhed so realistically about
the side-beams of the porch. At Nikkō or the Nishi
Hongwanji temple in Kyōto they might have impressed
us as masterpieces of creative carpentry, but
at Haruna the comparison was too trying. It was
hopeless to compete with God’s more monstrous
curios.</p>

<p>Here at last was a Shintō stronghold which did not
seem abandoned and desolate, but bore traces of frequent
worshippers. Above the sacred cisterns waved
blue towels, suspended after purification; at the feet of
a Shintōised Jizō rose a mound of propitiatory stones;
on the <em>kagura-dō</em>, or dancing platform, an old woman,
the priest’s wife, began her symbolic dance. As she
slowly revolved, shaking her bunch of bells or waving
her fan, she chanted words so venerable that all clue
to their meaning had been lost. Yet, in her faded
garb and shrunken person she personified more fitly
the solemn contortions of a dying faith than the smart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
young priestesses of Nara in their red silk trousers and
snowy mantles of flowered gauze. When those tripped
forward, with thickly-powdered faces and chaplets of
artificial wistaria, their garish aspect transformed the
temple to a tea-house, but in this sombre fastness at
the heart of Haruna we seemed to behold a very sibyl
of aboriginal Japan. The assistant priest was affable
but ignorant. A copy of the “Kojiki,” earliest of known
records of the Way of the Gods, was kept there, he
affirmed, but he had never opened it and might not
show it to strangers. In winter it was terribly cold,
and snow-storms would sometimes cut them off from
all communication with the outer world. When floods
made the torrent impassable the senior <em>kannushi’s</em>
children were obliged to do their lessons at home.
But summer brought troops of pilgrims to the valley,
and their offerings sufficed to keep the little band of
guardians at their posts. “Are you never afraid,” I
asked, “of the earth opening and the rocks falling?
Only this morning we felt a slight shock of earthquake
at Ikao.” The young priest smiled gravely. “No,”
he answered. “For more than five hundred years the
<em>kami</em> have protected their holy place. Why should
we be afraid?”</p>

<p>We made a small donation, and received in exchange
a printed promise of Ho-musubi’s and Haniyasu-hime’s
blessing, to which our names were appended.
Then, turning our backs on that grim sanctuary, we
climbed slowly back to the Tenjin Pass. As we retraversed
the plateau of Little Fuji, Nitobe San
described the student’s life at Tōkyō. Between 1890
and 1898 their numbers had increased from thirteen to
nearly nineteen hundred, so that a second university
was shortly to be inaugurated at Kyōto. But of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
course the Red Gate (as the Tōkyō University is
familiarly called) would remain the classic portal of
modern learning. The college of medicine, in which
his own studies were pursued, is entirely under German
influence: none but German and Japanese professors
give instruction. In the other faculties of law, engineering,
literature, science, and agriculture, English
teachers predominate. Most of the students work
desperately hard, but enjoy great liberty. The majority
are poor, and some have very rough manners. The
Emperor was informed on one occasion by his Chief
of Police, who had been summoned to receive orders
to repress anti-foreign demonstrations, that “the
offenders were invariably either rickshaw-men or
students.” Their life is far more gregarious than that
of Oxford or Heidelberg or the Sorbonne. In the
small block of residential buildings within the university
grounds six or eight young men read, eat, and sleep in
one room. These are a privileged minority of scholarship-winners,
and are subjected to rather irksome
restrictions in the matter of visitors and late hours.
But the larger number live in lodging-houses, where
practically no more control is exercised than over any
other class of citizens. Competition is so severe that
posts cannot be found for any but a small fraction of
the budding doctors, lawyers, and journalists who hope
to make a living in those professions. In consequence
the disappointed graduates turn <em>sōshi</em> and live
by their wits as spies, agitators, actors, authors, or
even as itinerant musicians. Naturally, extreme views
are adopted and discussed with the fervour of youth.
The wildest socialism, the narrowest nationalism, find
apostles. Though full of enthusiasm for most Western
innovations, Nitobe San was strongly opposed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
substitution of Roman characters for Chinese ideographs.
In vain I pointed out to him how the latter
blocked the pupil’s advance and impeded international
intercourse. He feared that such a step would not
only tend to destroy communion with the past, but
would also diminish the probability of that alliance
between China and Japan which was cherished as the
only means of checking Russian aggression. I formed
the conclusion from this and other conversations that
the salient qualities of a Japanese student are independence
and passionate curiosity. It did not surprise
me to learn afterwards from an English professor that
his classes had summaries of his lectures printed at
their own expense to facilitate the acquisition of new
ideas in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p>While we had been talking of his vices and his
virtues, the gregarious student had invaded Kindayu’s.
On returning to the hotel we encountered a band of
eight or nine stalwart young men wearing blue cotton
<em>hakama</em> (trousers so ample as to resemble a divided
skirt) and armed with small hammers. They had
come to geologise, disappeared on long expeditions
during the day, and only returned at a late hour. As
they shared a room and were by no means uproarious
at night, the other guests were scarcely conscious of
their presence. I think, however, that two pretty
schoolmistresses, the wives of officers in the army,
who had carefully abstained from making the acquaintance
of any other visitors, welcomed the arrival of
these ardent scientists. Their rooms adjoined, and
sitting on the threshold, that no beholder might misinterpret
their platonic comradeship, they indulged in
intellectual flirtation&mdash;a joy too subtle for the understanding
of their unsophisticated sisters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Ikao was in truth a microcosm of Japanese society.
Representatives of nearly every class came and bathed
and went their way refreshed in spirit, if not cured in
body, by the restful babbling water. One day an
ex-daimyō, who had held high office in a recent Cabinet,
arrived with a small retinue of relations and dependants.
Quiet and dignified, he was only to be distinguished
by a greater sobriety of manner from less
aristocratic neighbours. Occasionally odd instances
of polygamous experiment attracted general remark.
A Tōkyō merchant came accompanied by an elderly
wife, a blind baby, and two mistresses who had formerly
been geisha. The three women were on excellent
terms, and disputed only the privilege of spoiling
the thrice-mothered child. Every evening for them
was a “musical evening,” as the man had a good
voice and the geisha were expert <em>samisen</em> players.
Nitobe San described the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</i> as “a little barbarous.”
But, whether his opinion was shared by
many or few, it made no difference in the reception of
the new-comers, who were treated with the same frank
courtesy as less numerously married folk. Indeed,
frankness and propriety were marked characteristics of
this hydropathic paradise. If the bathers imitated
Adam and Eve in simplicity of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tenue</i>, their behaviour,
too, like that of our first parents before the Fall, was
faultless. Conversation was entirely unembarrassed
and perfectly decorous. The very publicity of this
hotel life was a guarantee of morality. And, in fact,
one could see that beneath extreme freedom of intercourse
careful etiquette was observed. Neither young
girl nor married woman ever went out alone: the tea-party
never became a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>. The <em>shōji</em> of the
apartments were generally half open; the amusements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
were such as to assemble and introduce the visitors to
one another. Dancing and flirting, as practised in
English watering-place or French casino, were unknown.
If the men desired other female society than
that of their own class, they could seek the <em>geisha-ya</em>
or <em>jōro-ya</em>. If many of the diversions were childish,
those of Brighton or Trouville cannot rank as intellectual
exercises. It was a lazy, healthy, happy sort of
paradise, and I did not live in it long enough to
discover the serpent.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent">On the seventh day of the seventh moon I bade farewell
to Ikao, and, loaded with little presents, descended
slowly to Takasaki. Regret at leaving that delightful
haven was soon lost in conjecturing the solution of an
astronomic mystery. Village after village flaunted a
galaxy of paper stars, which flecked the green background
of interminable trees with dancing flakes of
red, white, and blue. At every door stood a bamboo-stem
crowned with a cluster of five-rayed stars, each
ray being made of paper of a different colour. From
this astral chaplet long streamers floated in the breeze,
like the <em>gohei</em>, or cut paper inscribed with prayers,
before a Shintō shrine. At Takasaki station I met
Nitobe San’s sister-in-law, O Sen San, who was returning
to her husband’s house at Tōkyō, while the
student himself had gone to the more efficacious hot
springs of Kusatsu. Being fellow-travellers as far as
Akabane Junction, I begged her to reveal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> the
meaning of those starry signals which continued to
flutter gaily in every district we passed, as though our
train were freighted with royal passengers. Then I
learned that all pious folk were celebrating that day
the festival of Tanabata. The white streamers corresponded
in number with the children in each household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and on every one was written a poem desiring
happiness, especially good fortune in love, for the child
whose name was appended. More than this she did
not know, but a handsome young priest, who had
remarked my zeal for knowledge, kindly volunteered
the following legend:</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 smcap">The Herdsman and the Weaver.</p>

<p>“Long ago, as Chinese sages tell us, there dwelt in
Heaven a herdsman and a weaver on opposite sides of
the celestial river. All day the herdsman tended his
cattle, and was far too busily occupied to think of
taking a wife. All day the weaver sat at her loom,
making clothes for the Emperor, and this labour took
up so much of her thoughts that she even neglected to
adorn her person. Then the Emperor, remarking her
diligence and pitying her loneliness, sent for the herdsman
and said: ‘Inasmuch as ye are both so devoted
to my service, I will that ye shall henceforth be
devoted to one another. I give thee this woman in
marriage.’ So the girl crossed the river, and no
married couple ever lived more happily together.
But after a time the Emperor perceived that the
marriage, though it might be a good thing for them,
was an evil thing for him, since the weaver began to
neglect her work, and his clothes, which had formerly
won the admiration of his courtiers, showed signs of
hasty and careless weaving. At this the Emperor
grew very angry, and sent for the weaver and said:
‘Inasmuch as this marriage has been a joyful thing
for thee and for thy husband, but a woeful thing for
the Emperor of Heaven, I bid thee recross the river
and return to thine old home. Once a year, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
seventh day of the seventh month, the herdsman may
pay thee a visit, but on every other day in the year
let him see to his herding and thou to thy weaving.’
So the girl returned to her old home, and the river
flowed once more between herdsman and weaver; but
every year, when the feast of Tanabata comes round,
husband and wife are happy together. Therefore, all
who desire their children to be fortunate in their love
ask fortunate stars to shine upon them. Now, the
Emperor of heaven is God; the celestial river is
the Milky Way; the herdsman is a star in Aquila,
and the weaver is no other than Vega, brightest and
luckiest of stars.”</p>

<p>I thanked the priest for his pretty legend, and
cautiously approached the subject of religion, asking
if he had studied Christianity, and to what cause he
attributed its slow progress among his compatriots.
He answered that two facts, in his opinion, contributed
greatly to its want of success. The first was its extraordinary
similarity to Buddhism. The ideas of a
saviour of mankind resigning kingly power to become
a wandering beggar; of virginal motherhood; of
trinitarian godhead; of the beauty of holiness and
charity, love to men and kindness to animals; of
heaven and hell, as the populace conceived them,
though in reality but intermediary stages to the ultimate
Nirvana;&mdash;these, and the miracles attributed to
the <em>rakan</em>, or disciples of Buddha, which bore such
remarkable resemblance to the wonders attributed to
Christian saints, prayers for the dead, and monastic
institutions;&mdash;indeed, almost every salient doctrine of
Christianity, as taught by priests of the Roman See,
could be found with more or less modification in one
or other of the numerous Buddhist sects. Why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a believer, then, apostatise from the faith of his forefathers
to adopt a foreign creed so similar to, and yet
so remote from, his own? I found that his conceptions
of Christianity were derived from a Romish priest,
whom he had known in the island of Yezo. There
was also a patriotic reason which struck me as rather
unusual. The loyal Japanese believed that their
Emperor was descended from the gods, and in the
“Kojiki,” which is regarded with the same reverence
by them as the Bible by Europeans, many actions
implying divine power are said to have been performed
by such beings as the Heavenly-August-Sky-Luxuriant-Dragonfly-Youth,
by the Great-Refulgent-Mountain-Dwelling
Grandee, and by other <em>kami</em>, or
superior ones (“them that are above us,” Mrs. Dolly
Winthrop would have said), to whom it was impossible
to refuse the rank of deity. But the missionary said,
“Thou shalt have none other gods but Me,” which
commandment imposed on the convert the necessity of
becoming disloyal as well as an apostate. Yet, so
tolerant were Buddhist and Shintō believers, that they
did not subject a pervert to any sort of persecution.
They practised and allowed entire freedom of belief.
I replied that, granting his premisses, his conclusions
were irresistible, and we parted excellent friends.</p>

<p>At Akabane Junction I took leave of O Sen San,
and met by appointment Mr. Richard Bates, whose
acquaintance I had made about three months before in
a curio dealer’s Shop at Kyōto. As we had agreed to
take the waters of Akakura and Dōgō together, I
must apologise to him and to the reader for interpolating
a brief description of this invaluable companion.
His accomplishments were so numerous that I shrink
from detailing them, but they were all of such a nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
as to enhance the pleasure of travelling. He was a
good cook, a good nurse, a good photographer; he
had the infallible <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flair</i> of a curio hunter, and while
less wily collectors were hesitating and beating about
the bush, he would mark his prey&mdash;perhaps an old
lacquer bowl, perhaps a bronze incense-burner&mdash;pounce
on it, appreciate it, depreciate it, and by sheer force
of will-power whisk it away to his lair before the
dealer had made up his mind on the subject of price.
He had two deficiencies, which were also virtues on
occasion: he easily lost command of Japanese idiom
and British phlegm. As he chose to consider me a
fair linguist, it fell to my lot to translate arguments
and accusations which were violently impossible to
reproduce. However, I did my best, and was rewarded
by many scenes of rare comedy. I often thought he
would have done better to rely on himself, since
discussion gave the seller time to invent incredible
merits for his wares: at such times one glance or
gesture of contemptuous disbelief inspired more respect
for the buyer than languid protest, and that fiery
fashion of raiding a china shop, of assessing the stock
with the rapidity of a freebooter, and helping himself
to anything that took his fancy, was so appalling to
the deliberate, ceremonious vendor, that I believe
goods were frequently yielded up in terror and a
vague hope of appeasement. Not that Mr. Bates
invariably got the better of the bargain. It is my
belief that many geese sully with unsuspected falsity
the whiteness of his swans. But for him every
purchase was a swan, and, if you hinted otherwise,
the crime of a Frenchman who should express an
unpatriotic belief in Captain Dreyfus’ innocence were
light in comparison. I seldom committed that imprudence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
but indulged a secret hope that one robbery
balanced another, and that in the end the spoils of
war were equally divided. Commercial habit does
breed an instinct of distrust, which many tourists
would find discomforting; but this instinct was so
agreeably modified in my fellow-countryman by generosity
and justice, that on the whole we made as
many friends as enemies. If a landlord tried to cheat
us, we told him so with reprehensible directness; if
he treated us well, we gave him a handsome present,
and were as pleased as Diogenes would have been
had he pursued his famous quest by the light of a
Japanese lantern.</p>

<p>Men, honest or dishonest, interested us but little
that day, so absorbingly magnificent was the scenery.
At Akakura we should be in sight of the Sea of Japan,
while Tōkyō faces the Pacific, so that our route ran
north-west at an angle of about forty-five degrees,
very nearly from coast to coast of the main island.
The train would have to climb to a height of 3080 feet,
crossing by means of the Usui Pass the volcanic backbone
of mountains which culminates in Asama-yama
(8280 feet), the largest active volcano in the country.
As we steamed slowly up the steep gradient to the
grassy levels of New and Old Karuizawa, a series of
twenty-six tunnels, bored at such short distances from
each other as to resemble the disjointed sockets of a
gigantic telescope, provided intermittent glimpses of
jagged cliffs and terrific gorges. Far below lay green
valleys and plains, threaded by silver rivulets and
dotted with infinitesimal châlets; beside us, densely-wooded
slopes; to left and right, on the horizon,
Myyōgi San and the Kōtsuke peaks rose frowning
to the sky. Many passengers descended at Karuizawa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
for it stands on a lofty moor, where cows and wild
flowers flourish to the joy of European children.
Here the wise missionary builds his villa and transports
his family in the hot months. Donkeys and
bicycles, bestridden by sturdy, blue-eyed youngsters,
excite wonder in the meek pedestrian native, while
papa, untrammelled by clerical attire, manfully mounts
his five thousand feet and gazes into the red sulphureous
crater. Has not a local parodist thus celebrated
the annual exodus?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“When summer strikes Tsukiji</p>

</div></div>

<p>Alas! the pagan mountain-god, who when he
speaks will fulminate in fire and ashes, has been
dumb for more than a hundred years. He allows the
preachers of an alien creed to fill their lungs with his
life-giving air; he knows that their ingratitude will
take the form of denying his divinity. “And yet God
has not said a word.”</p>

<p>From Karuizawa, without breaking the journey at
Ueda or Nagano, we advanced more quickly to lower
ground, until the rapid torrent of Sekigawa, which
divides the provinces of Shinshu and Echigo, arrested
our attention and signified the nearness of our destination.
Leaving the railway at the little station of
Taguchi, we ascended in rickshaws the zigzag path
which conducts the pious to the sacred summit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Myōkō-zan. This mountain, on which snowy patches
still defied the August sun, is only one hundred feet
lower than Asama-yama, if the alleged height, 8180
feet, may be considered accurate. On the north-eastern
slope of this easily-climbed volcano lies the hamlet of
Akakura, from which rich plains stretch smoothly to
the sea. On clear days the island of Sado is dimly
visible. Hither come the farmers and traders of the
western villages and towns, bringing sometimes their
own provisions and demanding only sleeping accommodation.
The chief hotel, one-sixth of the size of
Kindayu’s, possessed a bath of its own, in which a
dozen persons could bathe, but in all the others the
guests paid a small fee to use the public baths, which
dignified the single street with all the glory of carven
cornice and stained glass. No other Europeans invaded
this unfashionable spa, whose boiling springs,
pellucid and blue, are credited by the peasantry with
marvellous curative virtue. Foreign food is not to
be procured, but we supplemented the rice and millet
with tinned meat and stewed fruit. Thus fortified, we
found no great difficulty in renouncing the more highly
civilised distractions of Ikao.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Dancers at Feast of Lanterns.</div>
</div>

<p>Geisha, dramatic reciters, jugglers, and itinerant
musicians never reach such solitary heights. But,
happily for us, the <em>Bon-Odori</em>, those antique dances,
which should have been danced on All Souls’ Day by
the modernised Ikao folk, began in this neighbourhood
two nights after our arrival. The landlord requested
a contribution of forty <em>sen</em> (about fourpence), which
we readily doubled, for the benefit of the performers.
Then ensued a long wait, for, if Japanese city-people
are dilatory, no adjective exists which could do justice
to the country-people’s contempt for celerity. Always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>accurate, Murray very properly translates <em>tadaima</em> (immediately)
by “anytime between now and Christmas.”
First one lantern entered the courtyard; after half-an-hour,
another; one by one the young men and
maidens assembled; forty minutes more elapsed before
the musicians could be induced to appear: at
last a flute-player and a drummer squatted on a mat
in the centre, while the dancers circled slowly about
them. Youths and girls wore a blue kerchief tied
round the temples: they revolved, as in a game of
“Follow my leader,” without ever touching hands;
two steps forward, a half-turn, two steps back, and at
irregular intervals a clapping of hands. Such was
the simple measure. But the waving of arms and the
graceful free gestures of these rustic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</i> were
only less effective than the strange chanting, which
rose or sank in volume as the number of participants
increased or fell away. And what do you suppose
they sang? Something in the following vein, one
might imagine:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“While we loudly dance and sing,</p>
<p class="verse2">Spirits of our dead return,</p>
<p class="verse2">Guided, where the lanterns burn;</p>
<p class="verse2">In the houses they will find</p>
<p class="verse2">Rice and water left behind;</p>
<p class="verse2">Then sail in boats of straw away,</p>
<p class="verse2">Until next <em>Bon-Odori</em> day.</p>
<p class="verse">Peasants, come and join the ring!”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Lines like these might emanate from an Arcadian
singer of Fleet Street, but the daughters of Akakura
must have lost all sense of the solemn festival they
were affecting to celebrate. What they sang was
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“My lad is handsome,</p>
<p class="verse">My lad is comely;</p>
<p class="verse">He has no money;</p>
<p class="verse6">Sad is my heart.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Only to meet thee</p>
<p class="verse">Troubled my heart is;</p>
<p class="verse">When the dance ends, I</p>
<p class="verse6">Ask to be thine.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">For custom in those parts has gradually established
the right of Love to oust Death from his old prerogative.
Dancing enables the lovers to find each other
more easily than at other times. Courtship is the recognised
sequel of the August revels so eagerly anticipated,
so long remembered. The love-sick maiden
is the first to avow her passion, as little girls choose
their partners at a London party. Perhaps the gentle
neglected ghosts bear no resentment, but are consoled
by the hope that one day it will be their turn to live
again as happily as these their descendants.</p>

<p>Acquaintances were not as easily made in Akakura
as in Ikao. The Kogakurō, as our hotel was called,
contained but few other guests, and we occupied the
two bedrooms which formed a sort of annexe, apart
from the rest of the building. In the public baths at
certain hours one was sure of meeting from twenty to
thirty bathers of all ages and either sex, but they were
extremely timid, kept silence when we entered, and
did not respond to friendly overtures, so that we
ceased to intrude upon their privacy. One old man,
however, was very fond of calling and cross-examining
the strangers. He had been a <em>samurai</em>, and at the
age of seventy-six retained full vigour of mind and
body. I should have given him ten years less. The
landlord expressed his opinion that this visitor was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Government spy, and cautioned us against talking too
freely. But, as it happened, the caution was superfluous,
for the dignified old fellow spoke in such queer
dialect that I could understand very few of his remarks,
and conversation soon lapsed into an interchange of
bows and smiles. Only one other circumstance occurred
in the Kogakurō during the fortnight we spent there,
to excite interest. One morning we found the cheery
little landlord very depressed because a fraudulent guest
had decamped during the night without paying his bill.
Of course, he had only to shoot aside the wooden
shutters, and the further feat of “shooting the moon”
presented no difficulty.</p>

<p>In this dearth of human subjects to study we acquired
a habit of making daily expeditions to neighbouring
localities, and were often repaid by beautiful
sights. Within two hours’ walking distance lies the
lake of Nogiri, which is larger than Lake Haruna, but
not so prettily environed. On a densely wooded islet
stands a temple of Benten, “the goddess of luck,
eloquence, and fertility,” to which we were ferried
across by an obliging schoolboy. Before it stand two
immense cedars, of which one boasts a girth of twenty-seven
feet. A long flight of steps leads from the shore
of the island to the shrine, and, viewed from the
summit of the steps, the belt of mountains which rim
the horizon amply rewards the climber. Except for
this view, however, Nogiri is in itself an ordinary
unromantic piece of water.</p>

<p>Far more exceptional is the important town of
Takata, several hundred feet below the level of
Taguchi, from which the railway descends a steep
valley between mountain walls precipitously grand.
Thousands of feet above snow is surmised, waterfalls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
are conjectured, but between them and the crawling
train push masses of impenetrable forest. Passing
Arai, with its petroleum springs, we reach flatter
ground and enter Takata, once the castle town of the
Sakakibara family, which shared with three others the
privilege of providing a regent during the minority of
a Tokugawa Shōgun. Traces of its old magnificence
and of the Tokugawa patronage exist in a whole
suburb of Buddhist temples, adorned in many cases
with the Shōgun’s crest. They are large, richly ornamented
with good carving, and approached by avenues
of cryptomeria. Since the Restoration and the Shintōist
reaction the fame of the Takata temples has
decreased, but their splendour is only to be eclipsed in
that part of the country by the celebrated Zenkōji at
Nagano. At the back of one row of these temples
runs a stream, spanned by as many little bridges. I
never expected to see the college “backs” of Cambridge
so admirably parodied.</p>

<p>The railway line is here the dividing-line between
sacred and profane. To the left of it the Buddhist
monks traffic in holy wares; to the right cotton and
cotton-cloth and a species of muslin peculiar to the
place compose the stock-in-trade of half the shopkeepers.
The latter reside in homogeneous batches,
as in feudal times: all the mercers in one part, all the
curio-dealers in another, and so on. But the most
curious feature in the town is the wooden projecting
roof conterminous with the street on either side,
which enables the pedestrian to perambulate the main
thoroughfare under shelter of an arcade. These are
not found in the eastern or central provinces, and
have been adopted on account of heavy snow-drifts,
which in winter render the roads impassable. We had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
cause to be grateful for this Echigo custom, as it
enabled us to explore the town without being drenched
by a heavy, inopportune shower.</p>

<p>Our longest excursion was to Naoetsu, a rising sea-port
at the mouth of the Sekigawa and the present
terminus of the Tōkyō and Karuizawa line. Though
it has long been a port of call for steamers which ply
on the western coast, it presented the appearance of
a new, unfinished town. Two months before a disastrous
fire had consumed three-fourths of the houses,
which were rising phœnix-like from the charred relics
of their own <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>. But fires are so common in these
flimsy, inflammable habitations that one ends by regarding
them as inevitable, as instruments of the
universal law of reincarnation, which applies equally
to men and to the works of men’s hands. Every
twenty years the two great temples of Ise are demolished
and reconstructed as antique ordinance requires.
Humbler buildings cannot expect to escape the fiat
of periodic resurrection. There is, however, little of
interest at Naoetsu, unless it be the hardy fisher-folk
and field-labourers. We drove to a fine temple of
Kwannon and some tea-houses surrounded by tasteful
gardens overlooking the sea. But we had seen their
analogues before: never had we seen in Japan, except
in the case of the wrestlers, such sturdy human frames
as these men and women of Echigo display. Husband
and wife, naked to the waist, strain beneath a common
yoke and draw ponderous carts to market. Their
bronzed busts and blue cotton <em>hakama</em> make grateful
patches of colour between the hot sky and dusty road.
My photographic friend could not resist the chance of
“taking” an Amazonian mother disdainfully recumbent
on bent elbow and suckling her child. As she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
lay supine and heavy-featured, she resembled a Beaudelairian
giantess in</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“The deep division of prodigious breasts</p>
<p class="verse">The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Could she really be of the same race as the fragile,
geisha-fairies of the Myako-odori? Her photograph
had better claim perhaps to the title of <em>miyage</em> than the
crystal and jade <em>kakemono</em> weights, which we bought
from a specious hawker on the cliffs. He who would
conform to Japanese etiquette, with its charming code
of trifling generosities, is sorely perturbed by this
problem of <em>miyage</em>. The dictionary defines it clearly
enough: “<em>A present made by one returning home from
a journey, or by one coming from another place&mdash;generally
of some rare or curious production of another
place.</em>” Now, I was perpetually “coming from another
place,” and the search before I left it for “some rare
or curious production,” which would serve as a present
for Ashikaga or Tōkyō friends, baffled at times even
my insatiable curiosity. The hawker’s streaked pebbles
were pretty enough as pledges of transitory kindness,
but the souvenirs most vividly stamped on the tablets
of remembrance by the glaring sunlight of Naoetsu in
August show a vision of brown sea-goddesses against
a turquoise sea.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent">The last lotus had shed its stately coronal of broad
petals before our short stay at Akakura came to an
end: business detained us in the capital throughout
the September rains; when we determined to take the
waters of Dōgō October was well advanced, and the
hills were already flushed with reddening maple-leaves.
As we sat on “the bridge that is joined to heaven”
and gazed into the maple-lined ravine, which is crossed
and crowned by the monastery of Tōfukuji, we seemed
to be watching the slow sepulture of that lingering
summer beneath a pall of fiery foliage. Yet we knew
that, though there on the hills around Kyōto autumn
was mistress of the woods, there still reigned on
the sheltered shores of the Inland Sea a summer of
St. Martin, the diaphanous ghost of summer, mild and
tender in heat and hue. There and then our trip was
planned. We would skirt its northern coast from
Kōbe to Hiroshima, spend a day in the holy island
of Miyajima, and thence take boat to Mitsugahama, the
nearest port to the Dōgō baths, whence a second boat
would take us back to Kōbe. Thus the circuit of the
eastern waters of the sea between Shikoku and the
Main Island might be accomplished in a leisurely ten
days. For the moment, however, we might as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fall in with the spirit of soft melancholy which all
persons of sensibility were bound to assume in the
presence of maple-leaves, unless centuries of minor
poetry should be coarsely disregarded. What season
could be fitter for making pilgrimage to Sen-yūji, the
burial-place of the Emperors? It is true that a sinister
sentence in the guide-book said, “As neither the
tombs nor the various treasures of the temple are
shown, there is little object in visiting it.” But for all
we knew, the warning might be piously designed to
save a sacred privacy from the more vulgar type of
tourist, whose eyes are blind to immaterial things. At
any rate, that was the time, if ever, to test the meaning
of Murray’s discreet dissuasion.</p>

<p>It certainly required no slight effort of imaginative
sympathy to appraise at its historic worth a most
paltry wooden bridge, devoid of grace or ornament,
which seemed a rustic plank in comparison with the
Shōgun’s red-lacquer <em>Mi Hashi</em> at Nikkō, so finely
poised and firmly flung across the foaming Daiyagawa.
But that was worthy of the military usurpers, who
took the substance of sovereignty and left its shadow
to their nominal sovereigns, while this is only <em>Yume
no Uki-hashi</em>, the Floating Bridge of Dreams, aptly
symbolic of the recluse <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rois fainéants</i>, absorbed in
sentiment and moonshine. Here, we are told, as the
midnight mourners bore along their dead emperor to
sleep with his fathers, they would throw down a little
fruit, some libatory cakes, into the whispering rivulet.
Then steep and dark before them rose the narrow
road, which terminates in a large hollow hewn out
of the hillside to be the cradle of the sceptred heirs
of the sun-goddess. Like the palaces in which they
lived, their houses of death are clean and august.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
The shrines are of plain white wood, of the sort else
used only in Shintō temples; the paths, scrupulously
kept, are strewn with small white pebbles and wind
spirally up mound after mound into the shadow of
thick pines. Six centuries of royalty are buried in
that white city with no other token of their rank
than strict seclusion and austere simplicity. Each
group of tombs is enclosed by a high wall, and on
every gate is the sixteen-petalled chrysanthemum.
There is no glitter of marble or gold, as in so many
burial-grounds of monarchy, no fulsome eulogy on
staring tablet, but, shrouded in the same mysterious
obscurity as had enveloped for the nation their half-monastic
lives, the Tenshi, sons of heaven, seem
fittingly interred in that precise maze of ordered
tranquillity half-way between the sky and their dearly-loved
Kyōto.</p>

<p>I could not bring myself to pass Ōsaka on the
way to Kōbe without visiting the temple of Tennōji,
where Mr. Lafcadio Hearn gathered some of his
happiest “Gleanings in Buddhist Fields.” Though
the children’s chapel has been so touchingly described
by him that any other writer may well shrink from
following in his footsteps, a rapid impression of a
fugitive glimpse will be pardoned and more than
justified if it should induce the reader to re-read
his more elaborate account. An enormous temple,
Tennōji lies on the very outskirts of the town, and,
after traversing innumerable canals, one is still a little
puzzled to locate the <em>indo-no-kane</em> among wide courts
grouped about the central colonnade. After some
searching we discerned a man and woman kneeling
on the threshold of a shrine, in which a wrinkled
priest in shabby brown vestments was reciting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
prayer. Drawing nearer, we noticed that the man
was weeping and the woman held in her hands a
baby’s <em>kimono</em> of brightly coloured material, which
soon after she handed to the priest with a few copper
coins. He took the garment, folded it carefully, and
placed it on a shelf. Then, raising our eyes from
the personages in this pathetic scene, we observed
for the first time the chapel itself. The altar bore
no image of Buddha flanked by gilt lotus or vases
of natural flowers, but from cloth to ceiling it was
covered with a bewildering pyramid of dead toys.
Almond-eyed mannikins and stiff-jointed maidens,
dolls of all classes, richly or penuriously dressed,
seemed to stretch imploring arms and to fix hallucinating
eyes on the beholder; drums and trumpets,
paper ships and indiarubber balls, masks and picture-books
and rattles&mdash;all the motley companions of
vanished children were huddled together like contorted
imps in a chaotic pantomime. Massed and motionless
in the twilight of their recess, they had the air of dead
things&mdash;the shells and figments of faithful toys, whose
spirits had followed the babies’ souls to paradise, that
the little hands which had clasped them night and day
in “this miserable, fleeting world” might not be quite
comfortless in their strange new nursery. The lesson
would not be lost on heartbroken mothers who parted
here from their own most cherished hopes more fragile
than these brittle playthings. The roof was hung, the
side shelves were piled, with tiny dresses, pendent or
folded; and, most curious of all, the bell-rope, that
summoned Shotoku Taishi, the saintly prince, to conduct
the dead infants to God was strung with overlapping
woollen bibs&mdash;yellow and red and green&mdash;the
clumsy counterparts, these, of aureoles. But while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
we had been enthralled by this canonisation of dolldom
the priest had been writing, and now handed to the
mother a slip of paper attached to a thin wand of
bamboo. Bowing low, she took the paper, pressed it
to her forehead, and crossed the enclosure to the stone
chamber known as the Tortoise Tower, for there those
who look down over the circular balustrade into a
central cavity will perceive clear water running from
the mouth of a stone tortoise. Into that sacred stream
which flows from earth to heaven the paper drops,
being inscribed with the new name which is bestowed
on every believer after death; and the poor woman
goes away not a little comforted, for now at least
her child is sure of an orthodox introduction to
paradise. Thus neither babe nor emperor is exempt
from etiquette, whether life or death be the master of
ceremonies. Inequalities persist in the very funeral
rites, though in their hearts the celebrants must feel
that the geisha’s flower-song is of universal application:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Peonies, roses,</p>
<p class="verse">Faded, are equal;</p>

<p class="verse6">Differ the flowers.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The beauties of the Inland Sea have been so often
and so graphically described, that detailed praise is
superfluous. Every one has heard of the thousands
of islets, on which are perched villages, villas, and
pines innumerable; of the hillsides, geometrically subdivided
into rice-fields; of the junks with pleated and
divided sails, which dart like white birds through the
exquisite blue plain; of the strange mirage, which
throws upon the sky at certain hours, when the
heaven above and the waters beneath melt into a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
silver-grey mirror, the shapes of phantom archipelagoes
suspended in mid-air. To those who have seen it and
are familiar with the fans, the <em>netsukes</em>, and the tea-cups,
which reproduce favourite designs of pictorial
art, only one adjective, vague yet precise, will occur:
this pocket-Mediterranean is essentially Japanese. It
is an ornamental piece of prettiness, designed by the
Celestial Painter in one of his most Japanese moods,
for in it you will find the cardinal characteristic of
the national taste, its subordination of the sublime
to the dainty, of big effect to graceful detail, its inevitable
preference for miniature and vignette. One
critic has said that such art “is small in great things,
great in small things”; another, that the Japanese
“admire scenes, but not scenery.” Both these dicta
could be applied to the Inland Sea, were it not that
Europeans admire it more than the natives, but the
charm which it exerts is undeniably akin to the
spell of those workers in silk or clay or ivory who
achieve a maximum of beauty in a minimum of
space. The Norwegian fiords, the Italian lakes, the
Ægean and Adriatic Seas, all present at some point
or other some grandiose aspect, but the channels
which lie between Shikoku, Kyūshu, and the Main
Island never threaten or impose; they are simply a
soft fluid setting for precious stones of varying size
and colour.</p>

<p>Most famous of these insular jewels is Miyajima.
As no boats were running thither from Kōbe, we
travelled by the San-yo railway as far as Onomichi,
skirting the coast so closely that we hardly once lost
sight of the sea. Though sorely tempted to break the
journey for the purpose of visiting the great feudal
castles of Himeji and Okayama, we pressed on until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the bay of Fukuyama, glittering like molten fire in a
superb sunset, was hailed with rapture and relief, for
the train journey had been hot and long, and we
welcomed the prospect of repose. One of those
delicious, indolent evenings, when the traveller reclines
on piled cushions, drinking tea or <em>saké</em>, until he be
roused from waking dreams by the low laughter of
attendant <em>musumé</em>, demanding permission to strew the
beds and light the lanterns, would have formed an
excellent climax to that fatiguing day. But I never
dared anticipate repose in the company of Mr. Bates,
who was apt to burst into sudden flame on the
slightest provocation. And during that week provocation
lurked in two hotels out of three. The guide-book
describes Onomichi as “a bustling, prosperous
place”: it may be “prosperous”; it is undeniably
“bustling.” We were barely out of the train and had
just set foot in the straggling main street, when two
hotel touts seized us by the arm, jovially aired some
broken English, and deposited us with our bags on the
steps of a large hotel. “Ask the price!” shouted Mr.
Bates, “ask the price! I have never yet entered
an hotel without knowing what I have to pay. Ask
the price!” I complied, but the landlord with soft,
evasive phrases, wafted us to an upper floor, while my
companion smouldered. Suddenly a chair and table
appeared. “Take them away!” he shouted, “take
them away! I know the trick. They will make us
pay double, and I refuse to be swindled.” This time
we insisted on knowing the charges, and the proprietor,
as we expected, demanded three times as much as we
had now become accustomed to pay. We protested.
He assured us that “honourable guests from Yokohama
and Kōbe” never paid less, but we replied that Kōbe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and Yokohama were nothing to us, who always paid
Japanese prices for Japanese accommodation. Finding
him impervious to reason, we shouldered our bags and
marched out of the house. Then he consented to
receive his due, and reinstalled us on our own terms.
But the hotel girls were cross and discourteous, the
native visitors noisy, the food bad and badly served.
As a last attempt to get the better of us, the landlord
affirmed that now there was no chance of a boat being
despatched to Miyajima before the following afternoon,
and that the information we had gathered from a
casual shopkeeper the night before, that one would
sail at eight o’clock in the morning, was erroneous.
But Mr. Bates had been compelled twice before to
spend an extra day in one of these seaside hotels, on
the plea that the boat had gone, or would only go,
apparently, at the landlord’s bidding. Smiling, therefore,
but without hesitation, we made our own way to
the wharf at seven o’clock and took our own tickets,
that there might be no collusion between the hotel-boy
and the official who booked passengers. At
eight o’clock we steamed away from Onomichi.
Through clustered islands our tiny steamer threaded
in and out, until Kure appeared, an important arsenal
at the foot of the Aki Hills. Here we discharged
some hundreds of copper slabs, and while that slow
operation was in progress were amused by the
animation which prevailed on the men-of-war and on
the numerous sampans plying between them and the
shore. About four miles away on the island of Etajima
stands the Imperial Naval College. When this and
other points of interest had been indicated to us by
polite fellow-passengers, our attention was riveted on
the labourers, who jerked the slabs from hand to hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and piled them on the floor of a barge in symmetrical
heaps. The “chantey” which they sang to lighten
the labour was simple and monotonous, consisting of
two words, which sounded absurdly like “Hong
Kong” and “Shanghai” repeated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. At
last we continued our voyage, but were again subjected
to a long delay at Hiroshima, where we landed and
beguiled the tedium of waiting by chaffering with
bum-boat women for sweets and chestnuts. The
town stands far back from the water, and a causeway
three miles in length runs out into the spacious
harbour, formed by the delta of the Otagawa. As
this is the most busy commercial centre west of
Kōbe, there was plenty of movement: rows of boats
were loading and unloading, rickshaws driving up perpetually
from the town, while shrill-voiced youngsters
did a brisk trade in fruit and vegetables. At the risk
of being left behind, my indefatigable companion
made a dash for the distant shops, and returned
triumphant, hugging in one arm two loaves of bread
and in the other a dilapidated Buddha, whose grimy
gilt was irresistible to the collector. His disgust when
I guessed the exact price he had paid (about five <em>yen</em>,
or ten shillings), and refused to believe that it could be
worth a penny more to any one, was too deep for
words.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen when Miyajima was reached,
and as we were rowed ashore the outlines of temple
and grove were shrouded in gloom. Only the <em>colossal
torii</em> loomed black against the shimmering water, while
all that lay behind was covered by the shadow of
climbing forests. We took supper at an hotel near the
entrance to the temple-grounds, and were then conducted
by two of the landlord’s daughters on a tour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
inspection through the main street. We discovered a
curio-shop, of which the proprietress set such extravagant
value on her wares that Mr. Bates at once was
lured into hot discussion. Night interposed, and at
an early hour, before I was well awake, I heard the
resumption of battle below my balcony. The proprietress
with gentle laughter and firm accent extolled
her treasures; the would-be purchaser, in nervous tones
which tingled with cupidity and despair, attempted in
vain to cheapen them. His patience was rapidly
giving way, and very soon he cried out for his interpreter
to descend and assault the enemy. But this
time I deliberately closed ears and eyes, feigning sleep.
I had not come to that holy island to fight for curios,
and though I had attained the knack of giving the lie
courteous to crafty dealers, I shrank from translating
rough language to a woman. Fidelity was routed by
chivalry. They finished the struggle without my
intervention, and victory remained with the lady.</p>

<p>When I descended, the defeated combatant was
seeking consolation in photography. And seldom had
his camera been confronted with more beautiful pictures.
The winding valleys and soaring rocks converge
at an elevation of more than a thousand feet on
a little shrine, in which has been burning a sacred
fire for more than a thousand years. From the
opposite shore, as one traces the salient features of
this evergreen island, all the details&mdash;streamlet and
temple-roof, cliff and maple and pine&mdash;merge in a
majestic harmony of serried line and luxuriant colour.
But on the island itself one is drawn, as by a magnet,
to the great temple of Itsukushima Hime, which,
being partly built over the water on piles, seems at
high tide, like the Breton vision of Is, to rise from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
depths of the sea. At all times the <em>torii</em>, or wooden
archway, which stands before this Shintō temple is
partially submerged, and Hiroshigi in his fifty-four
<em>meisho</em>, or views of Japan, gives such prominence
to it, that the long galleries and avenue of stone
lanterns, as well as the central hall, from which the
colonnades diverge like wooden arms, bent to embrace
the incoming tide, are barely suggested. Daimyō,
Shōgun, and Emperor have vied with one another in
decorating this temple, and the successive chapels are
hung with paintings by famous artists from the sixteenth
century to the present time. Many quaint
customs, formerly regarded as conducive to the purity
of a holy place, are still observed. Neither death nor
birth is allowed to sully its eternal immunity from
change. When either is anticipated, the patient is
ferried across to the mainland. Dogs are forbidden,
but deer roam the streets and feed fearlessly from the
hands of tourist or pilgrim. All day the temple-courts
are thronged with worshippers, and sometimes at
night, when a pious noble or rich American affords
himself the sight, the lit lanterns of stone or bronze,
which line the approaches to the temple, define the
interlacing courts and bridges in traceries of fire. But
this illumination we had not the good fortune to see.</p>

<p>Another temple on a neighbouring hill, though less
beautiful, is equally unique. It consists of a vast platform,
from which spring twenty-four massive columns
to support the roof, whose only ornamentation on the
interior, if ornamentation it can be called, is a frieze of
wooden spoons, some small, others enormous: they
are nailed there, or on the columns, as the donor’s
caprice dictates, and confer comparative immortality at
trifling cost, for each is inscribed with an autograph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Thus the ingenious Japanese have found a way of
diverting and profiting by that first infirmity of ignoble
minds, which robs St. Paul’s of dignity and desecrates
Westminster Abbey with such legends as “Peter
Jones from Hampstead” and “Eliza Smith of Bethnal
Green.” Much impressed by this strange custom,
each of us bought a spoon and, veiling our vulgarity in
Latin, suspended this device from the right-hand pillar
of the porch:</p>

<p class="pfs80">Venit, Vidit, Oravit,<br />
O. E. &nbsp; R. B.</p>

<p>For two months I had been haunted by visions of
the bridge-Kintaikyō, as it seems to have haunted the
landscape-painters of Japan. I remembered it as one
of the most remarkable in Hokusai’s series of “A
Hundred Bridges”; I had another marvellous drawing
of the five arches overwhelmed by a snow-storm
and apparently detached from both land and water, for
Hiroshigi understands the isolation of his subject from
irrelevant detail as few others, slaves of perspective,
would dare imagine. If uneducated eyes took the
picture to represent a peal of blue bells, sprinkled with
cotton-wool and straddling through space, so much
the worse for uneducated eyes. But at any rate,
being so near, I resolved to dispel vision by looking on
reality, and spent half a day in visiting Iwakuni. We
were obliged to leave our rickshaws at the foot of
Katō Kiyomasa’s towering temple that overlooks the
almost waterless bed of the Nishikigawa, for none but
a pedestrian could climb the huge arcs, thirty feet
long, which spring in five bounds from shore to shore,
like the curves of a switchback railway. Then the
faithful camera was brought into play, and a bevy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>perplexed ducks were hustled into the foreground, with
the inevitable result of attracting several loiterers to
share with them the glory of being photographed.
These had to be politely expelled, and in the end
several excellent views were taken. But not one of
them conveys the fantastic liberty of that flying bridge
so realistically as the snowscape of Hiroshigi.</p>

</div>

<p>Lulled by the honest countenance of our courteous
landlady into misplaced confidence, we were astonished
by her presenting on our departure a bill more exorbitant
than that of the hotel-keeper of Onomichi. We
expostulated, and repeated the terms named by her
clerk the night before. At once the amount was cut
down to half and the lesser sum accepted with no
gratitude or resentment. Mr. Bates is furious, and
delivers a lecture on probity; but I cannot bring
myself to regard these bland banditti, who extort
without violence and restore the booty without a
murmur, as on a par with the cheating innkeepers of
other lands. Their motive is probably either religious
or patriotic, perhaps both. Some one must have told
them that foreigners are only permitted by autochthonous
gods to visit Japan on condition of enriching
its inhabitants. By overcharging the tourist, then,
they are pleasing their gods and serving their country.
Their compatriots are protected by legal prices,
publicly posted in every inn, but they know that the
barbarian cannot read official notices, and quixotic
indeed would it be to enlighten him. To me such
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> graceful swindling (when exposed and thwarted)
is more delightful than churlish, prosaic probity.</p>

<p>Returning to Hiroshima, we thence took steamer to
Mitsugahama, one of the chief ports in the island of
Shikoku, whose mineral baths were the goal of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
voyage. Had time allowed, we would gladly have
visited all the four provinces of this magnificent island&mdash;provinces
which in earlier times were known as
“Lovely Princess,” “Prince Good Boiled Rice,” “The
Princess of Great Food,” and “The Brave Good
Youth.” But we had only leisure to do homage to
Iyo-Ehime, the Lovely Princess, who amply justified
her title by the loveliness of her domain. Between
her territory and that of Tosa or Take-yori-wake,
the Brave Good Youth, whose sons are to-day the
staunchest advocates of progress, runs a mountain
ridge, varying in height from three to four thousand
feet, so richly covered with forests that not only are
the pines, maples, and alders as plentiful as elsewhere,
but with these is intermingled an endless host of
beeches, oaks, and horse-chestnuts. Except in the
neighbourhood of Akakura, we had not seen a finer
stretch of mountain-scenery.</p>

<p>But we never came close to these wooded heights,
for Dōgō is only a short distance from the seashore,
and is reached in half-an-hour by what I can only
describe as a toy train. We crept into a first-class
carriage, and just managed to avoid bumping our heads
against the low-pitched roof. The fare was on the
same scale as the compartments, for the cost of the
ticket was three <em>sen</em> (farthings). The rickshaw-men
were polite and reasonable, the landlord of the Iwai-ya
both affable and honest; in a word, we had left the
track of long-suffering and all-corrupting tourists, and
had reached one of those districts, so pleasant to
discover, where manners are as yet unspoiled by
money. Delighted with our lot, we settled down to
three days of paradise regained.</p>

<p>Our first care was to discover the bath-house. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
front of the hotel rose a mansion of pine, surrounded
by iron railings of curious pattern, a line of storks in
zigzag flight, and surmounted by a stork of gold with
outstretched wings. The Governor’s house, we
thought, or perhaps a court of justice, resplendent
with carven symbol to impress the natives with reverence
for the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>. But no: this was the
principal bath-house. As we passed from storey to
storey and remarked the beauty of rafter and balustrade,
my companion, who speaks with knowledge,
declared that he had never seen such superb carpentry.
In many of the chambers were flowers and <em>kakemono</em>
by modern painters; in short, we had found a more
lordly palace of bathing than even Ikao could boast.
The baths were of granite and the dressing-rooms hung
with silken curtains. As we had paid the highest
tariff, ten <em>sen</em> (about twopence-halfpenny), before
entering the bath, we were served by daintily-robed
waitresses with cherry-blossom-and-water, a rather
saline concoction prepared from the national flower.
When we issued from the hot salt waters the same
attendants brought tea and cigarettes. Enchanted
with our first experience of Dōgō fashions, we returned
to the hotel and demanded of the landlord what other
sights the town possessed.</p>

<p>The public garden, the wood-carvers’ shops, the
big temple of Ōkuni-nushi and Sukuna-bikona, which
crowns a hill on the outskirts of the town, were duly
visited, and pronounced inferior to those we had seen
elsewhere. But O Yoshi San informed us at dinner
that every stranger who came to Dōgō was considered
unlucky if he departed without seeing and hearing two
beautiful sisters, geisha of shining notoriety. We
sent a summons at once, and by good luck it happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that one hour of their deeply engaged evening was
at our disposal. Our room was brightened up with
flowers and sweetmeats, <em>saké</em> and cigarettes were
lavishly provided, cushions set and lanterns lit. The
geisha were announced by their professional names&mdash;White
Jewel and Young Butterfly&mdash;made smiling
obeisance to the “honourable strangers,” and took
their seats in the centre of the room, while their
duenna, the Katti Lanner of Shikoku, whose pupils
had spread the fame of their teacher all over Japan,
remained respectfully in the doorway. The age of
Young Butterfly cannot have exceeded thirteen years.
She wore a white silk <em>kimono</em>, heavily embroidered
with gold, and gold dragons on a green sash chased
one another round her slender waist. In her coiffure
was an ivory pin, terminating in a miniature birdcage,
from which a red tassel fluttered defiantly. Her
pantomimic dances (in which she required occasional
prompting) represented the wooing of a coy damsel
and the capture of a standard in the Chinese war;
her childish emphasis of amorous and martial gesture
was extremely piquant. White Jewel was, however,
not only a clever artist but a most intelligent woman.
About ten years older than her sister, she was dressed
far more simply. Her <em>kimono</em> was of black <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crépon</i>,
her sash of iris-coloured brocade, and her hair had no
ornament but a purple iris. She sang, like all her
tribe, with nasal intonation and harsh lower notes,
but her smile when she talked was as bright as her
wits, quick to grasp my questions and explain the
meaning of her songs. Indeed, I owe to White Jewel
some of the prettiest instances of popular <em>dodoitsu</em>
collected in a previous chapter. She was very pleased
with her calling, which she had found lucrative, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
was not offended by the assertion that most people
considered geisha to be like cats, sly and treacherous;
otherwise, how was it they had acquired the nickname
of “Nekko” or “Pussie”? She replied by singing a
quatrain which conveys in the original two meanings
for every line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">’Ware of the Pussie!</p>
<p class="verse">Pussie, seen smoothing</p>
<p class="verse">Coat of striped velvet,</p>
<p class="verse6">Trimming her claws.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">’Ware of the geisha!</p>
<p class="verse">Geisha, seen folding</p>
<p class="verse">Soft-striped <em>yukata</em>,</p>
<p class="verse6">Binding her shoes.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">At this point Mr. Bates manifested a desire to bask
in the rays of White Jewel, and completely ousted me
from favour by a fraudulent piece of palmistry. As he
traced the lines in her sensitive hand he discovered
pledges of prodigious prosperity&mdash;rich lovers, increased
fame, long life, and ultimate marriage to a
deputy-judge! The only prediction which missed
the mark was a prophecy of twin daughters, who
should rival and perpetuate the glory of White Jewel
and Young Butterfly. The Japanese consider it rather
gross and catlike to have more than one child at a
time. White Jewel made a grimace of playful disgust
and offered to sing another song, which would be the
last, as other houses had engaged her to appear at ten
o’clock and at eleven. It was exactly half-past ten;
if she went now, her punctuality would be unimpugned.

<p>We devoted the second day of our visit to Matsuyama,
the capital of the province of “Lovely
Princess,” not more than four miles from Dōgō.
There is little to be seen there, however, except the
castle, one of the largest in Japan, and some excellent
curio-shops, in which the zeal of my companion was
rewarded by some precious finds. Leaving him to
indulge his master-passion, which I found less amusing
than the pursuit of living curios, I laid siege to the
castle. At the bureau where tickets are to be obtained
many officials referred me to one another, and requested
me to wait until certain formalities were complied
with. After two hours’ stolid patience the fortress
capitulated, and I was assigned to the care of a gallant
sergeant, who spoke a little English and proved a most
competent guide. From the summit of the tower a
fine panorama was visible: below us the fertile Matsuyama
plain stretched away to the shore of the Inland
Sea, and on the opposite side the horizon was shut in
by forest and mountain. To tell the truth, my conductor’s
account of the castle’s history, as illustrated
by its structure and some surviving weapons of war,
interested me much less than his own exploits. For
had he not with his own hand slain five Chinese braves
in the battle of Port Arthur? My compliments on his
heroism must have touched his heart, for, turning
suddenly, he grasped my hand and cried: “I like you.
You shall be my friend. I will dine with you.” This
abrupt proposition at once solved for me the embarrassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
question of remuneration. I could not press
surreptitious silver into the palm of this obliging lover
of England and slayer of Chinamen, but a friendly
dinner would put us on terms of franker intimacy. So
we descended the winding path from the ramparts,
crossed the moat, and marched home to the Iwai-ya.
We drank cherry-blossom and <em>saké</em>; we bathed, and
dined off the best fare which our host could provide;
we discussed the character of native and foreigner,
arriving at the conclusion that, while the best type of
Japanese inhabited Shikoku, the wiliest and worst of
foes were Russian. We had not time to go deeply
into ethnology, for at half-past eight my guest buckled
on his sword and with many protestations of affectionate
regard returned to barracks.</p>

<p>No shadow of trickery marred our joyous reminiscences
of Dōgō. When we left the landlord presented
a bill so ridiculously low, that we bestowed on him as
much again in tea-money. Not to be outdone, he
loaded our departing rickshaws with four bottles of
beer. And the photographer, whose camera was worth
a fortune to him as a means of gratifying all sorts and
conditions of men, took an excellent group of that
smiling host and his cheery household.</p>

<p>The voyage to Kōbe was no less agreeable. We
had for fellow-passenger a distinguished middle-aged
officer, who had fought on the losing sides in the revolution
and the Satsuma-rebellion headed by Saigō
Takamori, whose grave we had seen at Miyajima.
Experience had long since convinced him of the folly
of anti-progressive movements, and he realised as
clearly as the most democratic reformer that national
security was best served by adopting Western ideas.
We had no idea of his rank until a small boat put off at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Tadotsu, in which were three officers of inferior grade,
who had come to escort him ashore. From his seat in
the boat he waved his hand genially to us, while the men
pulled in to harbour, but the three officers remained
standing, as unmoved by the shock of the waves as
by the rattle of Chinese artillery.</p>

<p>Kōbe received us, weary and late, with hospitable
arms. In that prosperous port, so rapidly distancing
Yokohama in commercial importance, an English
colony is solidly entrenched with pews and cricket-bats
and pianos. I went to the club, and was at once
in England. <cite>The Saturday Review</cite> was reviewing and
<cite>The World</cite> revolving on the same lines as when I
was last in Fleet Street. Mr. Bernard Shaw was still
unmasking demerits in Shakespeare, while Mr. William
Archer was inventing merits for American comic
opera. In a moment of nostalgia I sauntered into a
well-filled church, whose congregation were listening
with rapture to a beautiful rendering of Gounod’s
“There is a Green Hill”: finally, I learned at a
friend’s table that a cricket-match between the ladies
and gentlemen of Kōbe was the burning topic of the
week. Between Mr. Bernard Shaw and Buddha
(vegetarians both), between Gounod and geisha, between
batting and bathing, lay the gulf which separates
the hard-hitting West from the lotus-loving
East. I could not bridge the gulf without a violent
effort. In fact, I felt a little ashamed on mixing with
my fellow-countrymen, so pious and strenuous and
practical. While they had been working and playing
as only Britons can, I had utterly forgotten that any
country except Japan could enthral and stimulate. I
had been taking the waters&mdash;of Lethe.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent">This is the love-story of René Beauregard and
O Maru San. It does not illustrate the cynical
conceit of a French dandy, æsthetically explaining
and profaning love to amuse an indelicate public, nor
does it demonstrate the folly of mixed marriages, in
which nuptial ceremonies, high-flown speeches, adultery,
and suicide are hypocritically served up to suit
the British palate. It is the straightforward story of
an ordinary attachment in the Far East between two
rather bad and rather good friends of mine, whose
notions of “good” and “bad” as translated into
deeds were lax, but, in their eyes and in that region,
not absolutely damnable.</p>

<p>M. René Beauregard had been in Tōkyō about a
fortnight, when I found him one evening at a print-seller’s
shop in the Ginza, surrounded by an inquisitive
crowd of admirers and much embarrassed by inability
to declare his meaning in Japanese. He was accompanied
by an hotel-boy, who, knowing no French
words but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon jour</i>, recognised
me with relief and solicited assistance. I was able to
extricate him from the curiosity of the bystanders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the plurality of prices to our mutual satisfaction, for
we returned together to the Métropole, the richer by
some rare prints and the promise of congenial companionship.
Literary reminiscence furnished many
bonds of common interest. We had witnessed, it
seemed, simultaneously several incidents which marked
the waning of old and the rising of new constellations
in the firmament of French art. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première</i> of
Rodenbach’s “Le Voile” and Rostand’s “Les Romanesques,”
the funeral of Paul Verlaine, the students’
repudiation of Brunetière and acclamation of Zola at
the Sorbonne, the banquets to Puvis de Chavannes
and Emile Verhaeren, had strangely enough united us
in the same company without opportunity of introduction.
But community of tastes counts for less in
friendship than charm of character. What particularly
pleased me in M. Beauregard was a modesty, not too
common among his compatriots, and a chivalry towards
women which the Quartier Latin had failed to destroy.
I had known so many <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits féroces</i> (as Daudet called
them), vaunting their talents and their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes fortunes</i>,
for whom a mistress ranked somewhere between an
advertisement and an absinthe. He was not an
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arriviste</i>, then; but neither was he a worker. Too
self-critical to write badly, too lazy to write well, he
ended by not writing at all, and, as his means permitted
him to play the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of spectator, he followed
various movements in art and letters with amiable,
intelligent passivity. He had come to Japan with the
object of studying on the spot the Kōrin and Shijō
schools of painting, but found his progress much
hindered by ignorance of the language, which he had
not seriously tried to learn. As we were both anxious
to see the <em>Matushima</em>, or Pine Islands, perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
most lovely of the <em>Sankei</em>, or Three Views, which the
Japanese celebrate above all others, it was resolved
to travel there together in search of grammar and
scenery.</p>

<p>About the grammar he was rather fastidious. A
personage of high rank, whom he had met at an
Imperial garden-party, had said jokingly: “Why not
follow the example of M. Pierre Loti and find a
second ‘Madame Chrysanthème’? We call such
persons in our idiom ‘pillow-dictionaries,’ and they
are the most instructive manuals in the world.” The
young Parisian was, of course, neither shocked nor
offended by the suggestion. Not only had he no
moral scruples himself about forming temporary ties
such as nine Frenchmen out of ten contract before
marriage, but he had come to a country, or so he had
been told, where such ties were neither illegal nor
dishonourable, but openly recognised, and where a
mistress did not forfeit her chance of ultimate marriage
when the relationship should be dissolved. But the
idea of buying a mate as one buys a horse or a
picture was repugnant to him, and he preferred to
wait a while, in the hope that Fortune would provide
an occasion of affection preceding purchase rather
than of a purchase which might or might not precede
affection. The geisha of the capital did not attract
him: they were too openly venal or brightly conspicuous
for his quiet taste, which desired gentle companionship
without such publicity as the appropriation
of a Tōkyō geisha would involve. So, for the moment,
scenery took precedence of grammar.</p>

<p>The journey to Sendai on the Northern Railway is
generally tedious, but was made more so by delays
and uncertainties of transit owing to extensive inundations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of the Tonegawa. Many passengers contemplated
the advisability of quitting the train and
proceeding by relays of boat and rickshaw. Happily
this troublesome alternative was avoided, and we
contrived to reach the dull but important capital of
the Rikuzen province shortly before midnight. The
next morning we travelled by a branch line to
Shiogama, the little port on the bay of Sendai from
which passage is taken to the hamlet of Matsushima
or the more distant Ishinomaki. We chose the latter
route, since it traverses the entire archipelago and
gives a more complete idea of the number and disposition
of the Pine Islands. Legend counts them to be
precisely eight hundred and eighty-eight, and, if one
disappear, eaten by the sea, another pushes up its
head, conveniently severed by a sword of water from
some broken peninsula. As the rocks never increase
nor diminish in number, so the thousand pine-trees,
which start from crag or shelf in every conceivable
posture, are never more nor less than one thousand.
From this banquet of volcanic tufa the ravenous Pacific
had crunched odd morsels, leaving for future meals
bizarre and bitten fragments, as capricious in shape as
its own appetite. Unfinished bastions, wild arches,
irregularly tunnelled rocks, cone and staircase and
plateau, lie densely or sparsely scattered over an
expanse of forty miles, like a herd of amorphous sea-monsters,
badly made and willingly abandoned to the
solvent action of time and tide. But then, as if to
apologise for the Originator’s clumsiness and to prove
that his failure may have been expressly intended to
ensure their success, on the backs and in the crevices
of the else uncouth stone creatures wave the thousand
arms of pine, softening rough contours with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
clinging green, protesting and protecting with graceful
curve, or beckoning with siren gesture to passing
mariners. Every island has its name, rooted in historic
or legendary allusion. To the Japanese one has
suggested “Buddha’s entry into Nirvana,” another
“The island of question and reply,” while a third
group is symbolic of “The twelve Imperial consorts.”
But our Western eyes could well dispense with that
strange bias of Eastern fancy which prefers to associate
form with meaning: for us it was enough to
glide slowly through the haunted waters, to watch the
blue waves foaming at the island’s edge or leaping in
the sunlight to meet the pine’s tentacular caress.</p>

<p>From the last of the islands to the mouth of the
Kitakami River, on which Ishinomaki stands, is a
rough stretch of sea exposed to the full force of the
Pacific rollers. Our tiny steamer was buffeted by
wind and rain, and my companion suffered such
agonies of sea-sickness that it took him two days to
recover health and spirits. By good luck we found in
the Asano-ya one of those cosy and coquettish hostelries
which only Japan can boast, where the eye is as
constantly charmed by good taste as the body is comforted
by good cheer. The sliding doors which
divided our apartment from others had panels of white
paper, flecked with clouds of gold-dust and framed in
black lacquer. In the <em>tokonoma</em> or alcove stood a
pink-flowered shrub and a peacock of bronze beneath
a beautiful painting by Kano Tan-yu. In vain we
offered to buy this <em>kakemono</em> from the landlord, or the
screen, which displayed fighting dragons on one side
and a noble tiger on the other. They were heirlooms,
which his children must inherit. Nearly everything
was pretty in the Asano-ya, except O Maru San. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was the landlord’s niece, an orphan Cinderella, condemned
by destiny to wait on her uncle’s guests.
While her better-looking sisters had found husbands,
she trotted contentedly about her work, laughing a
great deal and singing snatches of song. She was
about four feet ten inches in height; her face was too
large and too round, though this fault was somewhat
redeemed by fine teeth and soft eyes. She tried to
atone for plainness of feature by elaborate coiffure and
punctilious toilette; but, do what she would, she could
not escape from the category of ordinary squat village
girls, who remain at home while their prettier neighbours
fill the tea-houses and geisha-houses of Tōkyō.
Her parents must have had excellent judgment, for
instead of calling her Lily or Chrysanthemum or some
other flower-name whose irony must have pursued her
to the grave, they hit upon O Maru (Miss Round), an
unromantic but felicitous description of her person and
character. She had no angularities, moral or physical,
but was just an elastic, docile ball of Japanese womanhood,
both useful and playful; one of those domestic
conveniences which Confucian moralists regard as
admirably adapted to promote the peace and happiness
of man.</p>

<p>From the moment of René Beauregard’s entrance
until his departure from Ishinomaki, O Maru devoted
herself to his service. While his illness lasted she sat
beside him, bathing his forehead and anticipating his
desires. When he grew well enough to take part in
the expeditions which I proposed to neighbouring
temples or islands, she was waiting with his shoes and
hat on the threshold, bowing low as he went out; and,
when he returned for the evening bath, she attended
him with towel and soap, as assiduously and with as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
little false shame as Nausicaa attended Odysseus.
Observing that he seemed anxious to learn the language,
which she was quite incompetent to teach, she
managed, with much laughter and many misunderstandings,
to increase his vocabulary. She was
particularly proud of having interpreted two inscriptions
which hung framed in the vestibule of the hotel.
One, equivalent to “Welcome the coming, speed the
parting guest,” was thus worded:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Asa okuri yu mukai.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>More literally it reads, “At morning, honourably
send on his way; at hot-water time, honourably
receive.” The other was more difficult to render.
We disputed two versions, of which I commended the
first to M. Beauregard’s notice, while preferring the
second in our common interest. Like many maxims,
it was plausibly vague:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Omoi yokoshima nashi.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Could it mean “Love without naughtiness”? Or had
it the particular application of “Hospitality without
fraud”? I hoped the latter.</p>

<p>We remained for seven days at Ishinomaki, charmed
with the busy life of the place, which owes its prosperity
to slate-quarries and salmon-fisheries, with the
boats for ever passing up and down the Kitakami, with
Kinkwa-zan, “the golden-flower mountain,” that sacred
island on which in ancient times no women might set
foot, though the deer roam freely round the pilgrim’s
circuit or ascend to the shrine of Watazumi-no-Mikoto,
the Shintō god of the sea. During this week two
circumstances revealed to my French friend the fact
that O Maru was actuated by quite as much tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
as dutifulness in her solicitude for his welfare.
One day a Norwegian captain, coasting from Sendai
to the northern island of Yezo, put into harbour for a
day, and proposed to the landlord that the girl should
take passage with him for a couple of months in return
for fifty <em>yen</em> (about £5), but she displayed strong
repugnance to this not ungenerous proposition. On
another occasion O Maru, having innocently introduced
a handsome brunette, her bosom friend, to
Monsieur René, who did not disguise his pleasure at
the presentation, was discovered by him at the foot of
his bed convulsed by tearful jealousy. At first she
would only give negative replies to his questions.
“Nakimasen” (“I’m not crying”), and “Shirimasen”
(“I don’t know why I’m crying”), she said.
But at last she gave the reason. “Because you are
now tired of O Maru, and will honourably take notice
of O Kiku.” I must suppose that he found a way of
reassuring her, as the next day they were warmer
friends than ever; and it became plain to me that a
dictionary, plainly bound but a devoted pocket-companion,
had been providentially deposited for M.
Beauregard at the Asano-ya, Ishinomaki. Indeed,
the book was more anxious to be bought than the
buyer to acquire it, for as soon as the date of our
return to Tōkyō was given out O Maru begged her
foreign lover to take her with him, and extracted a
promise that, if her family made no objection, as soon
as he had made suitable arrangements he would send
for her to continue the studies which had begun so
pleasantly on the banks of the Kitakamigawa.</p>

<p class="pg-brk"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p class="p6" />
<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is one thing in Japan to make a bargain; it is
another and far more difficult thing to secure its fulfilment.
Though by no means infatuated with O Maru,
Beauregard had been touched by her devotion and
amused by her simplicity. What seemed to him
certain was that he had merely to send word to
Ishinomaki, and the faithful girl would fly to his side.
But this showed his utter ignorance of Japanese
character and methods of procedure. Before the two
were reunited, an interchange of six letters and thirteen
telegrams, spread over six weeks, taught him some
useful lessons touching the unimportance of time and
the futility of haste.</p>

<p>About ten days after our return to the capital, he
wrote a long letter to the Asano-ya, in which he
offered to take O Maru with him for two or three
months if her uncle made no objection, and enclosed
several <em>yen</em> for travelling expenses. Four days passed
and brought no reply. Then he wired: “Have you
received money? When are you coming?” and was
somewhat pacified by the answer: “Money received;
will come soon.” His knowledge of the language was
not then fixed, or he would have found little consolation
in the treacherous words, <em>sono uchi</em>, soon. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
two days and the uncle sent a very polite letter to the
following effect. They had all been much honoured by
the honourable stranger’s presence in their humble
home, and thanked him for his great kindness to
O Maru. She would very much like to travel with so
distinguished and noble-hearted a person, nor had he,
the uncle, any objection to her doing so. But he
would like to call august attention to the fact that he
had an adopted son who wished to learn French and
would make an excellent guide, if permitted to join
the party. He hoped the proposal would commend
itself to so kind a friend of the family as Borega Sama
had shown himself to be. Instead of pleasing “Borega
Sama,” this offer to include an “adopted son” in the
compact distinctly frightened him. He knew cases of
Europeans who had been led by liking for a native girl
to burden themselves with her incalculable relations,
but he did not consider that a trip of two months
should be encumbered by any such superfluous attendants.
So he wrote a courteous refusal. By this time
the vagueness of <em>sono uchi</em> preyed on his intelligence,
and, when its elasticity stretched to eight days, he
wired once more: “What do you mean by <em>sono uchi</em>?
When will you come?” And the answer appeased
him: “Will come before the end of the month.” But
the end of the month brought a second most affable
letter from the host of the Asano-ya, in which he
expressed his intense anxiety to oblige the honourable
stranger in every possible way, but it so happened that
just at that time O Maru could not be spared, as his
humble house was full of reverend pilgrims on their
way to Kinkwa-zan, the golden-flower mountain, and
these monopolised her services. He therefore would
send back the money which Borega Sama had so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
kindly placed at her disposal, unless he would wait a
few weeks longer, when she could join him, as the time
of pilgrimage would be over. We both regarded this
letter as a polite intimation that the incident was
closed. Either O Maru had misled her friend when
she assured him that her uncle wished her to take
the opportunity of travelling with a “noble-hearted
person,” or the old man had formed other plans for
his niece’s future which did not concern us. In either
case Borega Sama resolved to finish the matter. He
wrote briefly but plainly, being a little sore at so much
tergiversation, that he had no wish to inconvenience
any of his kind friends at Ishinomaki, whom he should
always remember with grateful pleasure, and, if he
ever returned to Sendai, would revisit them. Then he
turned his attention to prints and curios.</p>

<p>Many circumstances render the collector’s life particularly
exciting at the present time. Good finds
become scarcer every year; the chief dealers in Tōkyō
and Kyōto send their agents not only all over Japan,
but also to Europe in the hope of redeeming lost
treasures. Sometimes an old family or impoverished
temple is compelled by misfortune to part with the
works of old masters; sometimes the new masters of
the art of forgery palm off surprising imitations which
deceive even the elect. The jealousy of rival collectors,
the artifices of rival dealers, the uncertainty of
losing by one purchase what you gain through another&mdash;all
these aspects of the game render it quite as
amusing as other forms of speculation. To Beauregard
the beauty of his favourite designs naturally
outweighed their commercial value, but it was impossible
to escape the fury of competition which disturbed
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</i> in his bureau and the professor in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
study. Every morning Minami San or Ohara San
appeared with a stock of tempting pictures, and as
they perfectly understood the art of playing off one
buyer against another, you often paid too high a price
or delayed decision until a bolder and perhaps more
foolish gudgeon took the bait. Minami San was a
thin, melancholy man, with carefully plaistered hair
and irreproachable attire. He had the air of letting
things go at an appalling sacrifice, so that at times you
almost hesitated to haggle with him. He seemed too
gentle for his trade. But Ohara San roused defiance
and inspired respect. He was an obese, jolly man of
shrewd capacity. As he sat on your floor drinking tea
or taking snuff, his patience and persistence were
admirable. He interspersed the bargaining with merry
anecdotes and jovial information, as though he rather
sought your company than your cash, but nothing
escaped his twinkling eye, and, when a hasty covetous
glance of the would-be purchaser revealed a preference,
the wily merchant refused all abatement of price. He
was of coarser grain than Minami, who, when Beauregard
left the country, presented him with a very
good Kunisada, as a polite acknowledgment of his
many purchases. But Ohara lent him for a few days
an extremely rare series of pornographic designs by
Utamaro, and reclaimed them on the morning of his
departure.</p>

<p>One morning Ohara was unrolling a very spirited
<em>makimono</em>, copied from Keion’s “Flight of the Court,”
and giving a vivid representation of military pageant
in the fourteenth century. As the original is, of
course, not to be bought, we were on the point of
arranging terms, when the hotel-boy entered and
handed a telegram to Beauregard: “I have run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
away. What shall I do? Reply Saito Hotel,
Shiogama. Maru.” His first impulse was to reply
“Come at once,” for the unexplained opposition had
increased his desire to make a settlement, but, on
second thoughts, the consideration for women, which
I had already remarked as a kindly trait in his character,
prompted this unkind response: “Go home;
do not come to Tōkyō; will write.” The letter
took the sting from the telegram, for he explained
how foolish it would be to leave home without her
family’s consent, as it might well happen in such
a case that when he returned to France Maru’s
uncle might refuse to take her back. He repeated
that, unless she could be spared (and of course he
would recompense the hotel-keeper for loss of service),
their proposed trip must be abandoned. So, the
futile colloquy along the wires began again. Two
days after: “All right at home. Am coming soon
(<em>sono uchi</em>). Reply.” But this time the student of
Japanese was not to be put off with <em>sono uchi</em>. He
replied: “Come by first train to-morrow, or not at
all. Am leaving Tōkyō.” As a matter of fact, he was
going to Kose, while I was due at Ikao, and we should
travel together as far as Karuizawa. Late the following
evening, after spending the whole day in the
theatre, he was handed a telegram by the hotel
manager, who had not thought it his duty to send
direct to the Kabuki-za, in which were these words:
“I have missed the train. Box at station. Reply.
Maru.” Then the Frenchman lost his temper. He
was quite incapable of playing the Oriental game of
patience, and preferred to throw up the cards. This
reply, brutal in its brevity, was flashed to poor Maru:
“Too late. Do not come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>I had been at Ikao a fortnight, and absorbed by
new acquaintances, was beginning to forget the very
existence of O Maru San, when a long letter from
Kose conveyed the surprising intelligence that she had
at last joined Beauregard in that pretty little mountain
village. Soon after arriving he had been caught in a
violent storm on the slopes of Asama-yama, and had
contracted severe rheumatism. Unable to walk much
and feeling rather lonely, he wrote finally to Ishinomaki,
stating that, if she cared to travel so far and become
his companion for the remaining month and a half of
his stay, he would make all ready for her reception.
But, he added, her decision must be prompt and
definite. A third and last letter reached him from the
Asano-ya. “My niece,” wrote the old man, “would
like nothing better than to accept your kind proposal.
But in the town of Ishinomaki an alliance between an
honourable stranger and a humble Japanese girl is
looked upon with disfavour. How is it in Kose?”
A final telegram&mdash;“No difficulties here. If you come,
what train?”&mdash;evoked the answer: “Start by eight
o’clock train to-night.” And to his great astonishment
she kept her word. One afternoon he saw a horse, bearing
two bundles tied to a high saddle, of the protective
sort which is used for children in England when they
ride donkeys, ascending the glen from Yunosawa.
Rain had made the path impossible for rickshaws.
One bundle was O Maru, the other her luggage. She
had never been on a horse before, and had never taken
such a long journey alone by train, but, after two days’
travelling in the hottest part of August, there she was,
smiling and looking very happy at the sight of Borega
Sama. Little by little he discovered the reasons of
so many delays and prevarications. The landlord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
who had at first advised her coming, had been dissuaded
by some acquaintances of the Norwegian
skipper, who urged that, if she waited for the latter’s
return, it would be more to her advantage, since he
might take her for several voyages and make a longer
contract with the family than the French tourist cared
to entertain. Then she had “run away,” but only to
her aunt, who was an ex-geisha and gave dancing
lessons at Shiogama. At last, as no more news was
heard of the Scandinavian suitor, she received permission
to follow her own inclination; and, though the
journey had presented many terrors, she came, armed
with an <em>o mamori</em> (amulet) of Watazumi-no-Mikoto,
and, thanks to the care of that potent deity, attained
the goal of her long-thwarted desire.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent">Kose is an ideal lovers’ nest, hidden in the heart of
thick forests, where steep hills dip to a stream, now
visible, now invisible, but always to be tracked by its
trickling or tumbling song. Shady rambles and cool
retreats invite whispering confidence, but, to gain a
view of the rolling country, which culminates in volcanic
peaks eight thousand feet high, hard climbing
or riding is inevitable. O Maru was much too timid
and delicate to accompany Beauregard on these tiring
expeditions, and replied one day to a question as to
how she liked Kose, “Taihen yoroshi: ke’ domo miru
koto arimasen.” (It was very nice, but there was
nothing to see there.) Then he discovered that what
she most wanted to see, more even than the sights of
Tōkyō or Kyōto, was the famous temple of Zenkōji at
Nagano. It was believed by the members of the
Buddhist sect to which her family belonged that the
souls of the dead were first given rendezvous at
Zenkōji, immediately after death, before departing on
their long journey to other worlds. Her great wish,
therefore, was to make offerings of rice and incense to
Amida on the spot where her father and mother had
passed away, that they might know how lovingly she
cherished their memory. Two days later her wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
was accomplished. As they climbed the broad avenue,
lined with little booths, at which were sold rosaries,
candles, breviaries, incense, toys, and sweetmeats,
Beauregard realised for the first time what vast influence
is still wielded in Japan by the Buddhist faith.
Hundreds of pilgrims, in curiously-patterned white
dresses and palmer hats, moved with chatter and
laughter towards the chief gateway. On the left of
the entrance stands a nunnery, ruled by an abbess of
high rank, and those who cross a graceful bridge to
enter it find themselves between two large ponds
of pink-flowered and white-flowered lotos, about the
roots of which crawl sacred tortoises. Where the
shops end an avenue of gods extends <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'upto the main'">up to the main</ins>
temple. Not only Monju and Shi Tenno and images
of the chief <em>rakan</em> or disciples of Buddha alternate
with lanterns of bronze or stone, but the six Jizō,
elsewhere so humbly carved in common wood, sit
proudly prominent in white marble. O Maru had
bought a packet of rice, some sticks of incense, and
a little rosary, whose beads were daintily strung on
purple cord. Beauregard took off his shoes and followed
her into the main temple. In that enormous
building, two hundred feet in depth by one hundred in
width, the huge outlines of gilded gods glimmered
darkly, while rustling priests moved to and fro on
mysterious errands. From the multitudinous rafters,
whose number, 69,384, is said to correspond with the
number of Chinese characters in the Buddhist scriptures,
pigeons flew continually, and the flutter of their
wings, together with the jingle of copper <em>rin</em> tossed
lightly into the money-box, accompanied, without
distracting, the low mutter of perpetual prayer. When
O Maru approached one of the priests with her filial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
offerings, the old man looked rather inquisitively at the
handsome foreigner, but said nothing, and, signing a
certificate of piety, on which her name and the death-names
of her parents were inscribed, gave it to her
together with a circular pink sweetmeat, on which
was stamped a sacred wheel, typical of the law. Then,
twining the mauve rosary about her chubby hands,
she murmured three times “Namu Amida Butsu”&mdash;(“I
adore thee, O eternal Buddha”), and, as she left
the altar-rails, threw five <em>rin</em> into the treasury. Her
devotions were accomplished, and, much lightened in
heart, she rejoined Beauregard, who was inspecting
the precincts of the temple. Chief of the treasures
is a sacred golden group, representing Amida and
his two followers, Kwannon and Daiseishi, which is
supposed to have been made by Shaka Muni himself
from gold found in Mount Shumi, the centre of the
universe. Legend relates that the foes of the true
faith had done their worst to destroy this image: all
attempts to abolish it by fire and water and the sword
had failed: since the fourteenth century it has rested
inviolate in a shrine, shrouded by a curtain of rich
brocade. So carefully is it now guarded, that the
pious are only allowed, on payment of a small fee, to
behold the outermost of seven boxes in which it is
enclosed. Far more accessible is Binzuru, a hideous
brick-red deity, whose image stands outside the
chancel, to which position he is expelled for having
“remarked upon the beauty of a female” in violation
of the vows of chastity incumbent on Buddha’s disciples.
Binzuru is amply avenged for this harsh expulsion.
Wherever his ugly visage is seen, you will
find him caressed and surrounded by women and girls,
who firmly believe that they have only to touch his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
body and then rub their own in the same part, to
banish every pain, great or small, to which the human
frame is subject. As they wandered from one god to
another, Beauregard questioned O Maru about her
faith, which he found to be simple and firm. Once
she had seen with O Kiku a picture of hell at a temple
festival, in which fiery demons were inflicting such
tortures on unbelievers that, though their own belief
was orthodox, she and her friend had cried themselves
to sleep. It occurred to the Frenchman to ask
whether she had no fear of being punished for living
with him as his wife, but she replied that she had
never heard that that was sinful, unless she had been
promised to some one else. He asked her what was
the use of giving rice to the souls of the dead, and
whether she thought they would eat it; but she
explained that, whereas living people eat rice, the
<em>hotoke</em>, or spirits, only eat the soul of the rice, which is
there, although we cannot see it. She believed in
prayer, fasting, and amulets, but thought it wasteful
to spend more than five <em>rin</em> (about one halfpenny) a
month on the gods, since they required no clothing
and very little food.</p>

<p>From Nagano the pair travelled to Kyōto, where
they remained until the end of their six weeks’ honeymoon.
There I saw a great deal of Beauregard, who
was equally enamoured of Japanese art and his
Japanese wife. His days would be spent in visits to
those temples where good specimens of the Shijō and
Kōrin schools were jealously kept, but as he had
letters of introduction from an eminent professor and
painter to the authorities, he had exceptional opportunities
of pursuing his passionate study of the Kyōto
Renaissance painters. All the treasures of Daitokuji<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and Chionin, of Kinkakuji and Ginkakuji, were shown
to him. Sometimes he would spend many hours
among the early sculptures of Nara, or avail himself
of an invitation to scan the private collection of a rich
shipowner at Ōsaka. His contempt for Hokusai and
Hiroshigi was unbounded; words could not express
his dislike for what he called “the shallow, meretricious
judgment of de Goncourt.” I await with
considerable interest the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brochure</i> which he intends
to publish by means of the <cite>Mercure de France</cite> for
the edification and confusion of French connoisseurs.
But O Maru interested me more than Okyō’s fish and
Sōsen’s monkeys. I would often spend the evening
with them, and, as we conversed hotly in our barbarian
tongues, she would sit contentedly sewing and humming
to herself, delighted to make tea or furnish
information about her fatherland. Her own curiosity
was seldom excited, but now and then she betrayed
depths of astounding ignorance. One night Beauregard
had been reading me a chapter from Anatole
France’s delightful “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Livre de mon Ami</span>,” in which
that writer thus describes a characteristic reminiscence
of childhood:</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“J’étais bien payé de ma peine dès que j’entrais
dans la chambre de ces dames; car il y avait là mille
choses qui me plongeaient dans l’extase. Mais rien
n’égalait les deux magots de porcelaine qui se tenaient
assis sur la cheminée, de chaque côté de la pendule.
D’eux-mêmes, ils hochaient la tête et tiraient la langue.
J’appris qu’ils venaient de Chine et je me promis d’y
aller. La difficulté était de m’y faire conduire par ma
bonne. J’avais acquis la certitude que la Chine était
derrière l’Arc-de-Triomphe, mais je ne trouvais jamais
moyen de pousser jusque-là.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>With unconscious appropriateness she suddenly
asked, “Shina no kuni, Furansu no kuni, onaji koto
des ka?” (Are France and China the same country?)
Nothing could persuade her that thunder was not a
phenomenon peculiar to Japan, for she had always
associated it with the wrath of a Japanese deity. Any
breach of etiquette shocked her sense of propriety,
and she spent many unhappy moments because of
René’s remissness in two particulars. He always
accepted hospitality when offered by a Japanese friend,
instead of refusing at least twice for politeness’ sake:
he often forgot to beat down the price of something
which took his fancy, depriving both seller and buyer
of the joy of bargaining. These faults lowered him
in the otherwise indulgent eyes of his little consort.
Her delicacy in the matter of presents was very
marked. Though her lover was anxious that she
should buy a souvenir at every place they visited
together, he could never induce her to choose any
but an inexpensive trinket. To remedy this he
occasionally relied on his own judgment, but the
result was unfortunate. I remember that we returned
from Ōsaka with the prettiest roll of <em>kimono</em> silk to
be found in the bazaar, but when this was given to
O Maru she rejected it, explaining that such bright
colours could only be worn by a girl of fifteen or
eighteen. Her own age was twenty-two. On another
occasion he chose a sober, stuff of silver-grey, but this,
it appeared, was only suitable to a woman of forty.
After that he gave up using his judgment, and begged
her to spend what money she wanted in her own
way.</p>

<p>Her own way was extravagant, as we discovered
afterwards: it was only his money that she was chary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of spending. For, when he presented her with sixty
<em>yen</em> on the eve of departure, to his surprise she clung
to him and cried out excitedly, “Watakusi hachiju
yen hoshii!” (I want eighty <em>yen</em>!) As she had never
seemed mercenary, and had at first stipulated for fifty,
he could not account for this eager demand, which
was of course immediately accorded. But the next
day O Maru appeared in a very beautiful cloak,
lined with white satin, on which were hand-painted
designs by a well-known painter of Kyōto. She
had spent nearly the whole of her present, fifty-five
<em>yen</em> (about £5 10<em>s.</em>), on that royal garment, which
would certainly be the most handsome of its kind in
Ishinomaki. Her parting presents to René were
some prettily embroidered handkerchiefs of silk and
an original poem, which had more “actuality” than
literary merit. In fact, it was a very artless <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cri de
cœur</i>, and ran thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Sad is my love for</p>
<p class="verse">Beaurega Sama:</p>
<p class="verse">He goes, but I go</p>
<p class="verse6">Never, to France.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>I accompanied them to Kōbe, where the <i>Belgic</i>
was waiting to take passengers to San Francisco, and
charged myself with the duty of sending O Maru home
to her family. She came with us on the liner, and was
overawed by the huge steamer, with its crowd of loud-voiced,
whisky-drinking barbarians. Once she crept
closer to René, and asked him if he would return as
soon as his mother died. Filial affection, she knew,
had the first claim. Then she gave him a small
wooden wedge, on which was the name of her sea-god,
Watazumi-no-Mikoto, with injunctions to press it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
his bosom every day at the hour of noon. At last the
bell sounded to clear the decks. O Maru took off her
wooden <em>geta</em> and climbed down into the tug. Up to
that moment she had borne herself bravely, but when
she saw the lessening figure of her lover recede for
ever into the waste of waters, she sank down in a
storm of passionate sobs at my feet.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent">Six months later I was passing down the Rue Royale,
when I saw René Beauregard at a little table outside
Maxime’s with two companions, who were engaged in
a fierce dispute about the never-ending Affaire, while
his whole attention was absorbed by a letter, which I
knew from the texture of the paper to be Japanese.
Greeting him with effusion&mdash;for we had not met since
the <i>Belgic</i> sailed from Kōbe&mdash;I asked whether he had
any news of O Maru since his return to Paris. For
answer he handed me the letter, which, with some
trouble, I deciphered. It was to the following effect:</p>

<p>“To Borega Sama, 120, Avenue de Clichy, Paris.</p>

<p>“From the time of your coming to Nippon to the
time of your going back to your own country, as you
have been so very kind to me, I humbly render
thanks. To learn by your letter that you had safely
crossed so many countries and great seas was indeed
good news. I had fasted for twenty-three days and
offered daily prayers to Watazumi-no-Mikoto that you
might not fall into danger before reaching the house
of your honourable mother. I am living with my
aunt at Shiogama, and shall wait seven years in the
hope that you will come back. I pray for you every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
day, and shall never forget the happy times we spent
together in Kose and Kyōto. However long I write,
there is no end to it, so I shall look for a further
occasion to tell you my love. In respectful obedience,</p>

<p class="right padr2">“<span class="smcap">O Maru</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>The letter contained an enclosure, which it required
the intervention of a Japanese friend to interpret.
Whether the girl had herself written the six poems
which follow, or, as it seems to me more probable, had
adapted them with slight alterations from a popular
song-book, I cannot say. They form both epilogue
and moral to this typical tale.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent">Théophile Gautier, describing his travels in Russia,
declares that, whereas Moscow and St. Petersburg fell
short of the romantic dream-pictures which he had
conceived of them by reason of their fame, the reverse
was the case with Nijni-Novgorod, of which the name
alone allured his ear with chiming syllables. Having
reached the town with no other premonitory bias
than the spell exercised by its magical appellation, he
was ravished by the picturesque admixture of races
from every corner of the empire. This paradoxical
conflict between history and geography makes many
victims. I too had been haunted by the prestige
of a great name in Japanese annals&mdash;the name of
Ashikaga. As I studied period after period of the
turbulent evolution from feudal rivalry to military
usurpation, from military usurpation to constitutional
monarchy, it seemed more and more evident that the
Ashikaga Shōguns, during two-and-a-half centuries
of power, had been greater friends of art and learning
than any rulers before or since. At Kyōto I had seen
the golden pavilion of Yoshemitsu (whom Professor
Fenollosa compares with Cosmo de Medici) adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
with mural paintings and screens by the artists whom
he had imbued with the spirit of dreamy seclusion of
the Hangkow idyllists. Under his patronage Chinese
learning took root in Ashikaga University; the religious
plays, or <em>Nō</em>, acquired in the hands of Kiyotsugu
their claims to rank as aristocratic opera; the
war of chrysanthemums, between rival dynasties in
Yamato and Kyōto, was composed by an astute
compromise. In short, culture was not purchased at
the cost of firm government. Nearly a century later
came Yoshimasa, whose silver pavilion, where he held
æsthetic revels with his favourites, the Abbots Soāmi
and Shuko, was as pale a copy of his great predecessor’s
taste as his capacity to govern was inferior.
Effeminacy followed in the train of refinement. The
Ashikaga <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> left a legacy of civil war and ruined
peasantry for stronger rulers to replace by hardier
methods, but it also bequeathed the memory of a new
learning and a new art. To Ashikaga, then, urged
by misleading memories and the promise I had given
to visit Ikao comrades, I gladly repaired when September
rains depressed the face of Tōkyō.</p>

<p>Yamada San, rightly thinking that living friends
were of more interest than dead lions, took me
straight from the station to his father’s house, and
postponed all sightseeing until the morrow. Here I
first realised the patriarchal atmosphere of an old-fashioned
home. Father and mother were gravely
courteous, and took pains to show me polite attention,
but the son scarcely spoke in their presence; and
pretty O Mitsu, who looked extremely pale, became
mute as ivory. The entry of two cousins, who spoke
a little English, introduced some animation; and after
the consumption of tea and oranges O Mitsu was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
asked to sing me an old song, playful, if possible,
because the foreigner would find it more easy to
understand. Crouching over a long-stringed <em>koto</em>, she
sang (the weather was very hot) this popular mosquito
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“All you wives, lying</p>
<p class="verse">Outside the curtain,</p>
<p class="verse">Many mosquitoes</p>
<p class="verse6">Often have stung,</p>
<p class="verse">Till the Bell Seven</p>
<p class="verse">Clanged from the temple:</p>
<p class="verse">Such things a good wife</p>
<p class="verse6">Heeds not at all.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">It was explained that a wife would be showing disrespect
to her husband by taking rest under the mosquito-net
in his absence. If, therefore, he happened
to stop out all night, she must still wait for him, outside
the net, until the bell for matins sounded the
retreat of her winged persecutors. “The Bell Seven”
is named in accordance with old reckoning: the time
represented is really four in the morning, when the
Japanese day begins. That was the last I saw of O
Mitsu, for etiquette forbade her taking supper at my
hotel in company with her husband and father-in-law.</p>

<p>We spent the evening with the Tanaka family.
There, too, I observed the reticence imposed on
women in their own homes. Tanaka Okusama, who
at Ikao had discoursed so brightly on every possible
subject from ethics to Epaminondas, crept quietly from
one to another of her guests, offering tea and cakes,
but never joining in the conversation. Her husband,
who had a most genial, refined face, made an excellent
host: the four boys sat silently in a corner. Many
questions were put about European houses and habits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
for the Ashikaga of to-day, being a great centre of
the trade in cotton goods made from foreign yarn,
is accustomed to the sight of foreign commercial
travellers.</p>

<p>The antiquities of the place were disappointing.
The Academy of Chinese Learning, founded, if tradition
may be believed, in 852, after attaining its zenith
of prosperity under Yoshemitsu, has since gradually
declined. The great library of Chinese works is
broken up; only a few books remain. Of Confucian
relics there rests only an impressive bronze tablet,
with full-length figure of the sage, from which
“rubbings” are sold to the pious. A sinister black
impression of the gaunt, long-nailed philosopher, whose
teaching still broods like a shadow over the majority
of Japanese households, recalls to me, in the shape of
a colossal <em>kakemono</em>, that dusty, dilapidated school,
whose students are deserting it for Western lore. The
vast temple, however, standing in a grove of cryptomeria,
is still thronged by worshippers, and forms a
worthy link with the historic glories of Ashikaga. In
a side-chapel stand wooden effigies of all the Shōguns,
wearing the tall black court-cap and the moustache
with small pointed beard, fashionable from the fourteenth
to the sixteenth centuries. It is related that
three similar figures, preserved in the Tōjiin Temple
at Kyōto, were subjected to the indignity of decapitation
in 1863, when the Restoration party wished to
insult the memory of the Shōgunate, but did not dare
to outrage the still powerful Tokugawa. The heads
were pilloried in the dry bed of the Kamogawa, where
it was customary to expose the heads of criminals.
But Kyōto was at once the scene of their rise and
their decline. In Ashikaga itself their memory lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
as changeless and as free from insult as the tutelary
mountain rampart of Akagisan.</p>

<p>There being no hotel near Yamada’s dwelling, he
secured me a room in a geisha-house, with the result
that late revelry made sleep impossible. But a bathe
next morning in the rushing Tonegawa, with the exciting
diversion of shooting some rapids in a crazy
punt, invigorated me and amused a crowd of urchins,
who shouted from the bank, “We want to see the
naked foreigner!” By the end of the second day I felt
at home with the older generation of both families, and
was shown over warehouse, mill, and granary. Having
not omitted to present <em>miage</em> on arrival, I departed in a
shower of good wishes and small souvenirs. Yamada
senior, who had never before (so his son declared)
been willing to make the acquaintance of a foreigner,
insisted on my accepting a roll of <em>habutai</em> (white silk,
resembling taffeta), while Tanaka Okusama met me at
the station with a parting gift of pickles and poetry.
She had made the one, her husband the other. In fact,
he had added this <em>haikai</em> to his published works:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent">The holy province of Izumo should be visited in
October. Then the Shintō gods and goddesses,
deserting every other part of Japan, assemble at the
great shrine of Kizuki under the presidency of
Ōnamuji. But every year Ōnamuji must have sadder
news to tell his dwindling fellow-deities. At one
time his own temples on Mount Daisen were as many
as two hundred and fifty; these have crumbled to a few
mossy ruins. The goddess <em>Inada-hime</em>, whose lover
intoxicated with <em>saké</em> the eight-headed serpent and
cut the monster in pieces, that she might become his
spouse, is invoked by fewer youths and maidens
desiring happy marriages. On all hands the Shintō
Pantheon is being undermined by two strangely allied
foes&mdash;by atheism and Christianity. Though full of
sympathy for the august descendants of Izanagi and
Izanami, the creator and creatress of the Japanese
universe, I could not refuse the hospitality of a
Japanese Christian, whose unremitting kindness will
always be associated for me with the romantic beauty
of Matsuë.</p>

<p>From my hotel, which stood on the edge of the blue
Shinjiko lagoon, I was watching the little steamers
puff angrily to and fro, the endless procession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
passengers across the long curving bridge, and one or
two old fishermen wading in the shallows, when a
message arrived inviting me to take tea with Assistant-Judge
Nomura at his house on Castle-hill. Happening
to arrive before the other guests, I was first shown a
curious collection of prints, illustrating the costumes
and customs of ancient Korea, and a series of pictures
of all the ironclads belonging to the Japanese navy.
This mixture of old and new was very characteristic of
Mr. Nomura, who admired with enthusiasm Western
dress, furniture, and religion, but reverenced at the
same time his own national traditions. Naturally his
knowledge of the two was one-sided, and he was
happily unconscious that his fine collection of Inari
and Satsuma ware was simply insulted by the base
intrusion of a sixpenny London saucer. Four inhabitants
of Matsuë&mdash;two young lawyers, a musician,
and an old painter&mdash;were announced, and the host at
once took a more ceremonious tone. We all entered
the tiny tea-room, nine feet square, containing four and
a half mats, and were occupied for more than half an
hour with <em>cha-no-yu</em>, the august tea-making, which
seemed to me unnecessarily long, perhaps because it
was conducted by a wizard in a grey coat and blue tie.
I preferred the dainty witches of the Miyako-odori.
Besides the formal ablution and handling of accessory
instruments, at stated intervals a bell was rung, the
room was swept, we walked from the house to the
garden and back from the garden to the house with a
scrupulosity that would have satisfied Hideyoshi
himself. At last the august tea, thick and green and
hot, was presented to each visitor, who drank with
slow but noisy demonstrations of lip-homage, to testify
polite satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we adjourned to the sitting-room, where the
musician brought out two antique Chinese objects, one
bearing resemblance to a flute and the other to a violin
with shaggy, semicircular bow. On these he produced,
not without effort, very weird sounds, which I
was obliged to eulogise as being entirely novel and
remarkable, for I could not compare them with any
melodies familiar to European ears. I believe the
others shared my relief when a painting competition
was suggested, for they could all handle a brush as
easily as I a pen, and the eye is less fastidious than
the ear. The first bout was in three colours, sepia,
Indian black, and red, though the last was sparingly
used. The designs were rapidly and lightly touched
in&mdash;a hawk pouncing on a goose; a carp swimming
against the stream; a frog climbing up a reed; and a
terrified child, with shaven pate, running away from a
temple-dancer, masked by a lion’s head. Next a
batch of fans was distributed to the competitors, who
speedily adorned them with fanciful arabesques, in
which curled clouds played hide-and-seek with Fuji,
or moonlit pines peeped out from drifted snow. We
drew lots for these souvenirs of playful skill, and to me
fell the picture of the child flying from the lion-mask.
But at this point Mr. Nomura’s own children, two
charming little girls, brought us in presents of flowers
and cakes wrapped in silver paper. The rickshaws
were at the door; <em>sayonara</em> rang cordially in our ears;
one of the pleasantest calls I ever made came to an
end.</p>

<p>Curiosity prompted me to attend the service held by
native Christians in an abandoned Shintō temple perverted
to evangelical use. Most of the congregation
belonged to the more credulous sex. Mothers, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
their babies on their backs, sat in rows on mats,
while one or two chairs were placed for foreign visitors.
All joined heartily in the hymns and listened attentively
to the simple prayers. Sometimes a <em>shōji</em>, or sliding
shutter, was gently pushed aside, and an inquisitive
face peered in on the worshippers. The missionary, a
man of athletic frame, with the cold, fixed eyes of a
fanatic, preached with fervour on the subject of original
sin. He held the doctrine that perfection was to be
realised on earth, and believed that he had personally
attained it. From all accounts he was a hard-working
idealist, who spared no pains to make converts, but his
ascetic views must seem violently out of harmony
with the Shintōist easy-going faith, which has for
moral code the single maxim, “Follow your impulses
and obey the Emperor.” Although not subjected to
persecution, a native Christian hardly ever remains in
his birthplace. The Matsuë converts whom we met
had come from Hiroshima, Ōsaka, and other spots.
Some estimate of the progress of Western religion
among Matsuë merchants may be based on the proportion
of believers in the middle school, to which all
the boys of the better classes are sent. Out of about
five hundred boys and sixty masters, two boys and one
master profess Christianity.</p>

<p>Etiquette is luckily assimilated to foreign custom
among Japanese Christians. When Judge Nomura
returned my call, he was accompanied by his wife and
little girls, who were delighted with some dolls and
picture-books which I had purchased for them in
London. At first O Ai San and O Dai San, diminutive
damsels aged four and five respectively, sat
solemnly in a corner burning fireworks&mdash;<em>hana-bi</em>, as
they are called&mdash;with tied tongues and eyes fixed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the spluttering flowers of flame. But gradually they
thawed, and losing all their shyness, played battledore
and shuttlecock, blindman’s buff, and other games.
When the babies had gone home with their nurse,
the judge and his wife remained to dinner, and a
lay preacher, who spoke English perfectly, proved an
invaluable medium of conversation. As my guests
expressed a desire to conclude the evening with
hymns, we sang a great many, from which they derived
spiritual pleasure, while my knowledge of their
language was much enlarged. The lay-preacher had
always two or three hymn-books in his pocket, English
and Japanese versions being printed on opposite pages.
Suddenly this pious exercise was rudely interrupted.
A tipsy geisha, holding a <em>saké</em>-cup in her hand,
staggered into the room and addressed some bacchanalian
words to the lay preacher, who chanced to
be near the door. She had escaped from a rather
noisy wedding-party, which was feasting and clapping
hands in the room below, while the bridal couple had
retired and the <em>shimadai</em>, an emblematic group of pine
and bamboo, crane and tortoise, remained for a symbolic
centre of festal joy. We took this intrusion for a
hint to separate, and it certainly jarred on a devotional
mood. To my friends this apparition must have suggested
the “scarlet woman,” whose cup is full of abominations,
but I could not regard it in any other light
than the opportune assertion of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la joie de vivre</i>, protesting
against the gloomy gospel of Puritan restraint.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent">And yet the joy of living, dissociated from any principle
but that of self-indulgence, is apt to produce
strange types of Anglo-Saxon degeneracy. Dr. Silenus,
whose hospitality and frankness are a byword in Azabu,
would seem to have fallen victim to that fatal fascination
which Mr. Kipling ascribes to the lands “East of
Suez, where the best is like the worst; Where there
ain’t no ten commandments, an’ a man can raise a
thirst.” Thirst was never absent, and the decalogue
rigidly banished from the epicurean establishment,
which I take leave to describe as a warning and a
comfort to the “unco’ guid.”</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon was regularly set apart for pagan
revels, to which the whole neighbourhood was admitted,
for the large-hearted Doctor loved to see his house full
of friends and acquaintances. When you had skirted
the moat which encircles the imperial palace, and
climbed the steep <em>daimachi</em>, you hailed with relief a
row of houses, mostly inhabited by Europeans and
surrounded by similar high fencing. But, the gate
once passed, all similarity between Liberty Hall and its
respectable neighbours ceased. In no other courtyard
would you be greeted by the sight of a hawk, an owl, a
goat, and several monkeys dwelling together in unity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Lucullus, the goat, was an epicurean like his master,
but less eclectic, for his diet included wood and iron
and stones, nails and lighted cigars and boxes of
matches. Indeed, he might still be living, a triumph
of desire over digestion, had he not one day tried a
dose of refined camphor, which brought death and a
costly Shintō funeral.</p>

<p>Having penetrated the bodyguard of animals, you
would enter a large room, adorned with fine bronzes
and screens, which you had not leisure to examine, for
so many unusual sights claimed attention. At the
back would be masked dancers or musicians, rather
cramped for space by reason of the motley, semicircular
crowd of men, women, and children, who
filled the foreground as far as a row of chairs set in
the verandah for barbarian friends. Dominating all
sat the master of the revels, his huge torso bare to the
waist and profusely tattooed with elegant designs. As
he passed the whisky to the “parasites” (for so he
was accustomed to call the band of adherents who
made his house their own), the genial, rotund Doctor
looked the very incarnation of Ebisu or Silenus.</p>

<img src="images/i_281.jpg" width="525" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Lion-Dance on New Year’s Day.</div>
</div>

<p>The first dancer on the afternoon of my arrival was
Kabukei-jishi, the boy in a lion’s mask, whose figure
is so familiar in Japanese streets on New Year’s Day.
Kabukei, a native of Echigo, is said to have originated
and given his name to this realistic dance. Though
the children must have seen it often before, some of
them laughed and others cried with terror, as the
clever mimic crawled up to them roaring, or scratching
himself, or shaking his ears. Then followed a comic
scene between two peasants and a Daimyō, who was
obliged to defend himself with sword and fan against
the heavy hoes of his disrespectful henchmen. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>medical comedy, probably inspired to some extent by
Dr. Silenus, had for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">motif</i> a quarrel between a physician
and a farmer, whose wife was expecting to give
birth to a child but had no wish to complicate an old-fashioned
process by new-fangled medicine. The
outspoken dialogue did not shock the unsophisticated
audience, for whom Nature is not swathed in conventional
veils of reticence, but the actors observed the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne coram publico</i> maxim to this extent, that the birth
took place in the wings, to be followed by a rather
thrilling infanticide. Bloodshed is always pleasing to
the playgoers of Tōkyō. The last piece to be performed
was a duologue between Kitsune, the fox-god,
and a greedy rustic. Kitsune carried a bag of
rice, and offered a mouthful in reward for every athletic
or acrobatic feat which the other should succeed in
imitating. When the gilt-snouted fox had set the
example of leaping or balancing with adroit agility,
the sly lout would make a clumsy pretence of doing
the same, and always managed to obtain the rice by
chicanery. At last the god discovered that he was
being tricked, and killed the peasant with a blow from
his rake. Nothing seemed to amuse the Azabu
children so much as the antics of these two.</p>

<p>On another occasion Dr. Silenus invited a large
party to witness a still more interesting exhibition in
his garden. If I have used the word “degeneracy”
to express his repudiation of certain moral ideas to
which the Anglo-Saxon race pays the compliment of
formal adherence, it should yet be added that his
“self-indulgence” included the laborious pleasure of
teaching himself the art of sword-making. Under
Japanese tuition he had attained great proficiency, and
if his blades did not rank with those of Masamune and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Muramasa, at least they excited the admiration and
envy of experts. Between him, therefore, and those
martial patriots of his adopted country who in their
hearts regret the swashbuckling days of old, before
barristers and deputies were minted from a foreign
model, latent sympathy could not but exist. Now the
<em>sōshi</em>, to whom allusion has already been made, and
whose nominal profession might range from that of
vagabond actor to that of political agent or bravo,
have this in common&mdash;they love a life of roving
independence, while owning loose allegiance to some
momentary chief. As constitutional methods take
deeper root among their compatriots, it becomes more
difficult for them to practise an avowed calling which
shall serve as a centre of organisation. In the summer
of 1898 one of them hit on the brilliant idea of
founding an Association for the Revival of the Noble
Art of Self-defence; that is, the euphemism was
closely akin to the title by which lovers of boxing in
England and America glorify their taste, while the
object was to promote skill in the use of lethal
weapons. The Doctor, whom I regard as a thorough
<em>rōnin</em>, or unattached “wave-man,” refusing to bow
the knee to social or ethical Baals, became at once a
subscribing member. He used to declare that this
adhesion procured him privileged places at almost
every public function which he attended, so potent is
the freemasonry of his brothers-in-arms. At least I
can certify that it procured for us a spectacle of unique
and amazing skill.</p>

<p>The first combat was between a swordsman and a
spearsman, in which I fully expected that the lighter
arm must easily prevail over the cumbrous and more
lengthy one. But I had reckoned without the swivel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
which made the lance in dexterous keeping a formidable
instrument. When the swordsman, abandoning the
defensive, tried to strike down his opponent’s spear
and deal a close thrust, the latter with the rapidity of
lightning drew in his weapon, and shooting it out
again before the other could recover his ground, drove
the point home. In four bouts out of five the spear
proved mightier than the sword. Then it was pitted
against a more archaic compound of pickaxe and
boomerang. To a small-headed axe was attached an
iron ball by a long cord, with which the holder tried
to entangle his adversary’s lance. He slung the ball
with his right, and if successful drew a dagger with
his left hand to plant the conquering blow. That
many of the fencers could use either hand with equal
effect was proved by the next series of encounters
between two-sworded and one-sworded men. These
had been very carefully matched, and the superior
skill of the man who was armed with but a single
sword in three cases out of seven decided the result.
Like a wise <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrepreneur</i>, the Chief of the Sōshi had
reserved his most sensational contest for the end.
Female warriors are no novelty in Japan. The
Emperor, even up to the time of his restoration to
actual sovereignty in 1868, counted among his troops
a corps of Amazons, whose training was as severe and
whose prowess as remarkable as those of the <em>Samurai</em>
themselves. When a stalwart woman came forward
armed with a halberd and wearing the same wide
<em>hakama</em> as her opponent, whose arm was a sword, she
astonished us all by the vigour and dexterity of her
onslaught. The war-cries which she uttered were
very terrifying, and I am inclined to attribute her
victory rather to them than to any hypocritical chivalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on the part of her adversary. I wondered if this
muscular virago obeyed the Confucian ordinance,
“A woman should look on her husband as if he were
heaven itself, and never weary of thinking how she
may yield to her husband, and thus escape celestial
castigation.”</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent">I was seated in the office of that flourishing Tōkyō
newspaper, <em>Yorodsu Chōhō</em>&mdash;waiting for my friend the
sub-editor, whose name, Kishimoto Bunkyo, will one
day be famous, when my tedium was enlivened by an
apparition. In spite of the care taken to entertain
foreigners in the waiting-room of that popular journal,
I had been bored. The square of Brussels carpet, the
presence of table and chairs, the permission to keep
one’s shoes on, the literary delights afforded by
Macaulay’s “Essays,” Washington Irving’s “Sketchbook,”
and Mr. Stead’s “If Christ came to Chicago”&mdash;all
these things failed to dispel that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>, born of
perpetual waiting, which only Oriental patience can
endure. Suddenly entered this welcome apparition,
feminine, furious. “Is there any one here who speaks
English?” it asked impetuously. The old door-keeper,
catching at the sound “English,” muttered
the word “Kishimoto,” and climbed the stairs in
quest of my friend. The apparition and myself were
thus left alone, and eyed each other furtively, with
embarrassment. At any other time I should have been
delighted to make the acquaintance of this pretty,
smart American, but an instinct warned me that her
business was private and delicate. I pretended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
be absorbed by the dreary violence of Mr. Stead.
Kishimoto descended, alert and smiling. The apparition,
thrusting a lady’s visiting-card before his eyes,
did not smile, but said rapidly:</p>

<p>“That’s who I am. About that paragraph in
yesterday’s paper; who wrote it?”</p>

<p>“It was our reporter, madam. He is not at the
office to-day, but if you wish to make an appointment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can he speak English?”</p>

<p>“No, madam, but I shall be pleased to put my
services at your disposal, if I can be of any use.
Personally my responsibility is limited to the English
column, whereas&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know, I know. Well, just tell your reporter
that my husband’s real mad about this, and he don’t
intend to let it drop. Likely as not, he’ll be round
here with a horse-whip, if your editor don’t make some
kind of apology or explanation. Good-day to you.”</p>

<p>The apparition disappeared as suddenly as it had
arrived. I looked reproachfully at Kishimoto. “Personal
paragraphs?” I asked. “Are you trying to
attack Americans with their own weapons? And why
don’t you leave ladies alone?” He explained that
Mrs. Kurumaya, the pride of Idaho, was married to a
Japanese professor, and had recently come to Tōkyō
with her husband. As there happened to be a German
from Idaho in the same hotel, the materials of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage
à trois</i> were too tempting to be neglected by a sharp
penny-a-liner. Hence the paragraph, the scandal,
and the apparition. “And what next?” I asked.
“The editor will censure his informant, insert an
apology, and banish the matter from his readers’
memories by fresh paragraphs of a similar character.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes after we had forgotten Mrs. Kurumaya
and her grievances, for Kishimoto had invited me to
visit his quarter of Hongō, and on the way thither
we engaged in a vain effort to find the grave of
the painter Hokusai. Yet the indications given by
Professor Revon in his careful monograph seemed
exact. We discovered the little monastery of Sekioji
(divine promises) near Asakusa, and, having traversed
the short avenue of cherry-trees which leads to the
temple door, began our search among the black, lichen-stained
tombs. In the third row we should have
found a stone bearing on one side the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Hokusai, of Shimōsa Province,</p>
<p class="verse">Famous Genius, Sincere Man,</p>
<p class="verse6">Died May 10, 1849.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">and on the other a poem, which the old man of eighty
composed on his death-bed, one summer evening half
a century before&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Lightly a man’s soul,</p>
<p class="verse">Lightly a fire-fly,</p>
<p class="verse">Passes in summer</p>
<p class="verse6">Over the plains.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">But though a young priest came to our assistance, the
neglected row of undecipherable inscriptions guarded
their secret, and we were obliged to give up the
search.</p>

<p>Kishimoto could not understand the foreigner’s
admiration for Hokusai, and regarded it with the same
tolerant contempt as most Germans exhibited thirty
years ago towards admirers of Wagner. “There is
nothing noble,” he cried, “in his pictures, nothing
sublime. He simply reproduced the vulgar street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
scenes in which he lived. Even his drawings of Fuji,
the holy mountain, are defiled by grinning carpenters
and ostlers.” He promised to show me specimens of
what his countrymen considered far higher art when we
should reach his father’s house, and in effect, when
we were seated in a pretty tea-room, overlooking a
large garden, he unrolled for me some fine <em>kakemono</em>
by Sesshu, Yeitoku, and Kiyonaga, which his family
cherished with intense veneration. But nothing could
arouse in me the enthusiasm which he evidently felt
for three or four pieces of Chinese calligraphy. There
was, of course, no colour in such masterpieces, no
historic or anecdotic interest, for he assured me that
the words themselves had no particular depth or beauty.
Their sole charm consisted in the divine sureness of
touch, which had traced the intricate flying characters
through a maze of stroke and curve, and it seemed
to my untrained intelligence that to appreciate them
properly one must be a brush rather than a man.</p>

<p>From <em>kakemono</em> we turned to masks, of which he
had a splendid collection. Students of Japanese
demonology could have told me many weird stories of
the cruel, leering monsters, whose faces reflected so
vividly the devilish imagination of their makers. But
Kishimoto only knew one story, and that rather a
pretty one, concerning Kijin, whose rank in the diabolic
hierarchy I have not been able to ascertain. He had
it from a Buddhist nun, his aunt, and it bears every
mark of having been invented <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour les jeunes filles</i>.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 smcap">The Story of Kijin and O Kamma San.</p>

<p>“When her mother died O Kamma was so overcome
with grief that she lost for a time all interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in living. Every day she laid flowers on the grave
and every night she cried herself to sleep. But, when
a month had passed, her father, who was of a gay
disposition, loving music and <em>saké</em>, scolded the girl
severely, saying, that since it was the will of Heaven
that his <em>sezénnin</em>, or faithful housewife, had left the
world of tears, it was undutiful to make the survivors
miserable by perpetual Ah-ing, and impious as well.
So O Kamma kept a bright face while she went about
her household duties, and contrived every evening to
slip up the hill to the temple of Kiyomizu-dera, where
she prayed to the Most Compassionate One, the
goddess Kwannon, whose countenance was gentle as
her mother’s had been. But when this habit had
brought her into a peace of mind which was not
remote from happiness, her father took a wife from
among the geisha of Shimabara, whose jealousy and
cruelty soon made her stepdaughter’s life unbearable.
She discovered that the girl’s chief pleasure was her
nightly visit to Kiyomizu, and, as she did not dare to
forbid her openly to go to the temple, she would set
her long tasks, saying, ‘You must not leave the house
until you have mended all the <em>shōji</em>,’ or ‘First finish
embroidering this <em>kimono</em>.’ But O Kamma worked
twice as hard as before, and never once missed her
evening prayer to the goddess. Then the wicked
stepmother tried to frighten her out of going. One
night she hid herself behind a pillar of the temple, and
when the girl entered darted upon her wearing the
fearful mask of Kijin, whose teeth glittered fiercely in
the twilight. But O Kamma said, ‘Bite me if you
will, O Kijin Sama; I shall still say my prayers.’ And
then the tables were turned. For a scream of terror
came from the geisha’s lips, and when Kamma rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
from her knees she saw that the devil’s mask was so
tightly fixed that it could not be removed from her
stepmother’s features. The latter, in an agony of
fright, cried out to the girl to pray for the help of the
Most Compassionate One. So Kamma interceded
with Kwannon, and the demon let go of the wicked
woman’s face; but from that time she lost all beauty
and lightness of heart, nor did she interfere any more
with the filial piety of O Kamma San.”</p>

<p>Having shown me his private treasures, Kishimoto
very kindly proposed taking me to some exhibitions,
which would at least be strange, if not beautiful. We
drove first to the Chrysanthemum Show at Dango-zaka,
where my friend pointed out to me more kinds of
blossom than I can remember; but some, by reason of
their fanciful names, it would be impossible to forget.
There were “White Dragon” and “Sleepy Head,” a
heavy disc with towzled petals; “Fisher’s Lantern,”
of which the dark lustre showed like velvet beside
the blushing pink-and-white complexion of “Robe of
Feathers”; “Starlit Night,” resembling frost-flowers;
and, most marvellous of all, a galaxy of various sorts
and colours, radiating by the grafter’s patient skill from
a single stem. Fearful of outraging his refined taste
by such vulgar curiosity, I persuaded the sub-editor
to wait for me in the tea-house which faces the river,
while I followed some gaping women and children into
twopenny shows which delight and instruct the simple.
There, trained over trellis-work or encasing figures of
wood and wax, the docile chrysanthemum evokes
familiar scenes from legend or play. Chrysanthemum
warriors pursue chrysanthemum maidens; chrysanthemum
Danjuro dances the cryptic measure of Jiraiya
before a chrysanthemum frog; chrysanthemum elephants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
castles, warships, monkeys, and demons compose
a fantastic universe in which the flowers seem
turned to magic serpents, which simulate and strangle
all other creatures.</p>

<p>“What do you think of them?” asked Kishimoto,
when I rejoined him. “Have you ever seen such
monstrosities before?” “No,” I answered; “they
suggest to me a collaboration between Madame
Tussaud and the author of the ‘Arabian Nights.’”
“Well,” he said, “since you mention the ‘Arabian
Nights,’ how would you like to hear one of our
professional story-tellers? Shall we dine at Asakusa
and go to a <em>yosé</em> afterwards?” “You anticipate my
heart’s desire, and lay up for yourself undying gratitude.
Let us go to a <em>yosé</em>.”</p>

<p>At the Isemon Restaurant delicious shrimp-cutlets
and delightful geisha made of dinner a rather protracted
ceremony. When we arrived at Tsurusé,
near the Nihon-Bashi, only a few seats at the back of
the room were unoccupied. We had paid 30 <em>sen</em>
(about sevenpence-halfpenny) at the door, and the
<em>nakauri</em>, a daintily-dressed waiting-maid, charged only
twopence for tea, cushion, and tobacco-box. On the
curtained platform at the opposite end of the hall a
<em>zenza</em>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutant</i>, was relating a comic anecdote,
which greatly amused his auditors. Like so much
Tōkyō humour, the laughter was calculated to flatter
the townsman’s shrewdness at the countryman’s expense.
A farmer, whose son had gone to make a
living in the capital, received a telegram asking for a
pair of new shoes, stout and solid, such as only the
provinces can produce. Proud of his telegram, the
first which had been received in those parts, and
believing the mischievous information of a neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
who saw his way to an excellent joke, the father had
the shoes made and hung them on the telegraph-wires,
never doubting that they would at once be transported
to Tōkyō. Soon after the crafty neighbour
took down the shoes and substituted an old pair of his
own. When the farmer happened to pass by in the
evening, he was astounded by the excellence and
promptness of telegraphic communication. “Look,
my friends,” said he; “in half a day I can send my
son a pair of new shoes and receive his old ones in
return.”</p>

<div class="caption">A Professional Story-teller.</div>
</div>

<p>The <em>zenza</em> was followed by a <em>tezuma</em>, or conjurer,
whose tricks, though exceedingly deft and graceful,
were such as I had seen before. Then came a mimic,
whose impersonations of popular actors provoked
much applause. At last, after a musical performance
which served as interlude, the famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raconteur</i>,
Sukeroku, continued his elaborate historical romance,
dealing with a Japanese Perkin Warbeck, whose pretensions
to the Shōgunate had caused much dissension
among the adherents of the Tokugawa dynasty.
Evidently the frequenters of the <em>yosé</em>, like the bulk
of playgoers, prefer mediæval to modern topics. As
the venerable author tapped with his fan on a little
wooden slab to emphasise his points, and passed with
rich elocution from incident to incident, the audience
followed with rapt attention. Abruptly, as it seemed,
he arrested his narrative, and the formula “To be
continued in our next” was legible in the half-expectant,
half-disappointed looks of his hearers. Before
leaving I gathered a few particulars about the profession
of a <em>hanashika</em> or story-teller. An established
artist, or <em>shinuchi</em>, will receive 100 <em>yen</em> (about £10) a
month (during half of which period one tale will continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>from night to night), or perhaps 60 per cent. of
the takings. He may receive this sum from three or
four <em>yosé</em>, since the <em>hanashika</em> form a corporation and
have branch-houses in all the chief towns. Many of
the more famous, like Hakuen and Encho, publish
their stories after they have been delivered orally. I
was not able to hear the English story-teller, Mr. Black,
whose knowledge of Western literature and Japanese
speech enables him to draw on a larger <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répertoire</i> than
his colleagues. Foreigners who desire to accustom
their ears to the sound of the language will find the
<em>yosé</em> infinitely more useful than the theatre, for the
style is less literary and the diction less artificial.</p>

<p class="noindent">I was dazzled by Jiraiya. He bewildered my senses
with sleight of hand and foot; he soothed my conscience
with bold sophistries. For two <em>rin</em> I would
have caught up an uncouth pike, assumed outrageous
armour, and followed that robber-chief unhesitatingly
to glory or to death. Vaguely I could remember
being stirred in boyhood by the prowess of Robin
Hood, by the fortunes of Aladdin, but here was a
magnificent being who rivalled and surpassed both
heroes in his own person. Like the outlaw of Sherwood
Forest, he defied the powerful and helped the
humble; judges and soldiers trembled at his name,
which was breathed with blessings by the poor but
grateful receivers of stolen goods. When the Government
at last put forth its strength to crush him (and
here his superiority was incontestable), instead of
calling on his men in green to empty their trusty
quivers, he had merely to summon his attendant
sprite, a green frog, which could be trusted to spout
fire until the last representative of futile authority
should be utterly consumed. I had seen him dancing
on the back of an awful dragon, which the frog vanquished
before the beast had time to swing its tail;
I had seen him dancing defiantly on a mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
covered with snow, while his whirling spear threatened
a score of enemies dancing round the base: suddenly
the mountain changed to a fire-spitting frog, and the
enemies danced no more. Perhaps it was this decorative
fashion of dancing in battle which reconciled me
to the wholesale slaughter of so many brave men.
At the moment I merely felt that they were hostile to
Jiraiya and well deserved their doom. Similarly, it
seemed no more than the deserts of my loyal enthusiasm
when a courteous attendant, bowing to the
ground, brought a message to my box to the effect
that Jiraiya would be pleased to see me in his dressing-room
when the curtain fell.</p>

<p>I followed the attendant down winding passages, and
was shown into a small wooden compartment, which
contained grease-paint, brushes, dresses, and in the
corner a dignified old man, with eyes as sharp as Ibsen’s
and the gravity of an archbishop. In his expression
was no hint of robbery, dancing, or witchcraft. I looked
round for the green frog, but the only other occupants
of the room were two young ladies in sky-blue <em>kimono</em>,
whom I afterwards discovered to be the actor’s
daughters. They never miss one of their father’s performances.
Presenting the letter which Mr. Fukuchi
had kindly indited, I begged permission to interview
Jiraiya at length on several phases of his complex personality.
Ichikawa Danjuro (how well the stately
syllables suited his demeanour) replied that he would
be pleased to receive me any afternoon in the following
week at his own house, where he would be resting
between two engagements. But I knew that a magician
(and, above all, a Japanese magician) held time
to be of no more consequence than life or death, so I
specifically demanded Wednesday as my share of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
timeless immortality. The request was granted: the
applicant retired.</p>

<p>I have known actors so devoted to their art that
they treat every incident, however trivial, as a matter
of theatrical importance, and impose on every acquaintance
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of a spectator. They grasp your
hand with that fervour which warms the heart of the
gallery, and take leave of a lady with glances such
as melt the stalls. This exaggerated consciousness
of his calling is utterly absent from Mr. Danjuro, who,
off the boards, becomes less of an actor and more of an
archbishop in proportion as he realises every year the
growing prestige and veneration attached by the bulk
of his compatriots to the chief of the Japanese stage.
To them he is a great deal more than the successful
acquirer of fame and money: he is the inheritor and
transmitter of a great tradition, a living link with that
pictorial old Japan which, beaten back by modern
innovation outside the theatre, holds its own gallantly
in the unstormed fortress of national drama. His
habitation is in complete accord with the honourable
position held by its proprietor. Good taste and simplicity
conceal all traces of the wealth which is his.
Opposite the reception-room is a small lake, decorated
with trees and huge ornamental stones such as the
Japanese æsthete loves, since they recall, as far as may
be, the freaks which Nature loves to play with forest and
mountain. The rooms are of white wood, beautifully
planed, and the only objects which suggest the theatre
are <em>fuda</em>, or long laths, hung with wreaths and bands
of silk, on which are inscribed tributes of admiration
from tea-houses, geisha-houses, and guilds of various
kinds. When the master entered, wearing a quiet-coloured
<em>kimono</em> of grey cotton, he greeted his visitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
(my friend Kishimoto had volunteered his services as
interpreter) with grave cordiality, and, having ordered
a servant to bring in coffee and cakes, proceeded to
answer my questions with imperturbable kindness.</p>

<p>“My family,” he said, “have been actors for nine
generations. My earliest recollection of the stage dates
from 1840, when I was carried on in my father’s arms,
an infant of three, for introduction to the public. As
you may know, the fashion of adoption plays a considerable
part in all our confraternities. Great names
are never allowed to die out. Thus, at the age of
eighteen, I took the name of Gonjuro, being adopted
by the manager of the old Tōkyō theatre, and it was
not until my father’s death in 1874 that I became
Danjuro the Seventh, so styled. Danjuro the First
made his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> in the year 1673.”</p>

<p>“And which is your favourite part, Mr. Danjuro?”</p>

<p>“I prefer historical plays, which revive old ideals
and present noble figures for the emulation of posterity.
In my opinion the best plays are those which stimulate
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'patriotism. Perhap'">patriotism. Perhaps</ins> ‘Kajincho,’ in which Benkei,
disguised as a priest, enables Yoshitsune to cross the
bridge and become master of Kyōto, is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> I like
best.”</p>

<p>I had long since made the acquaintance of Benkei,
the Devil Youth, and the feats both of mind and body
which he achieved for the sake of his youthful victor,
ever since the latter had defeated him in single combat
on Gojō bridge, were familiar to me both from coloured
prints and the representation of “Funa Benkei,” by
members of a <em>Nō</em> troupe. It was evident that the
star actor had a weakness for “sympathetic” parts, and
no doubt his mien and manner were admirably adapted
to the impersonation of majestic priests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have many of your actors the intellectual power to
conceive and render historical heroes?”</p>

<p>“No; I fear it must be admitted that the great fault
of too many actors is illiteracy. But in my young days
we were scarcely to blame for this. The Government
actually forbade us to receive any other than a theatrical
education, which, as then understood, sufficiently taxed
our time and strength. We were obliged to learn and
reproduce exactly the traditional tones, gestures, and
actions associated with any particular part.”</p>

<p>“What is your opinion of foreign methods of
acting?”</p>

<p>“I have only seen a few amateurs at the Legations,
and cannot form an opinion. But when Mr. Fukuchi
and Mr. Osada wrote a little piece in one act, half in
French and half in Japanese, in which I had the honour
of appearing with Madame Théo, I found it most
difficult to sustain my part, since the lady’s words and
by-play were alike mysterious.” A grim smile accompanied
this souvenir of that comedietta, “The Green-eyed
Monster.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have improved in many ways on the
old-fashioned style of acting?”</p>

<p>This widely cast question invited such a shoal of
answers that the conscientious examinee paused to
consider.</p>

<p>“I will try to mention a few of the changes which I
have done my best to bring about. The first thing I
aimed at was greater freedom of interpretation. Tradition
weighed like a millstone on the actor’s neck.
Instead of painfully and slavishly copying a predecessor,
I set the example, as soon as I felt influential enough,
of forming and putting into action my own conception
of a character. But it was a hard task. Then I tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to introduce more natural diction. Ranting and hollow
declamation were the rule. Even now one is compelled
to pitch the voice very high on account of the music,
which some actors find an aid to delivery.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t that most fatiguing for the voice?”</p>

<p>“Not in well-built theatres, like the Kabuki-za, where
the vaulted roof leaves nothing acoustically to be
desired.”</p>

<p>“And your famous facial expression?”</p>

<p>“Ah! that, I think, was a real reform. The old
actors’ faces were barred with red and blue stripes to
make them look ferocious, and, though they may have
terrified the audience, they could not impress it in any
other way, for variety of expression was impossible.
Now, without discarding paint altogether, we aim at
conveying all the emotions by play of feature, leaving
sometimes to the musicians the task of rendering them
into words.”</p>

<p>In this respect I was able to confirm the actor’s
words by personal observation. Nothing had struck
me as more peculiarly characteristic of a Japanese
audience than its delight in histrionic grimace. The
loudest applause, the frenetic shouts of “Hi-ya!
Hi-ya!” had been evoked in my hearing, not by
repartee or tirade, but always by convulsive contortions
of visage in moments of supreme misery or rage.
The word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grimace</i> connotes, I am afraid, that contempt,
allied with coarseness of sensibility, which the
stoical Anglo-Saxon is apt to entertain towards more
gesticular and sensitive races. But some of Sara
Bernhardt’s death-scenes would be appreciated at their
full value by the acute, minute observers of Tōkyō,
just as all Paris was thrilled and captivated by Sada
Yacco’s realistic dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is the social status of the actor higher than it used
to be, Mr. Danjuro?”</p>

<p>“I think it is. Speaking for myself, many of our
nobles and one of our princes have done me the
honour of inviting me to their houses, but such invitations
are by no means common. The illiteracy of
actors, to which I alluded just now, is a barrier to their
social advancement.”</p>

<p>“If I may broach a delicate question, will you tell
me if the paragraphs circulated in the Japanese Press
are correct? They state that your season of four
weeks last April in Ōsaka brought you in a sum of
50,000 <em>yen</em> (nearly £5000), and that out of this
amount you gave away in presents something like
20,000 <em>yen</em> (£2000).”</p>

<p>The old man smiled, less grimly. “It is quite
true,” he said. “But the presents are imposed by
etiquette, and such customs are more or less reciprocal.
The total receipts of the theatre, as certified by the
Government auditor, after the tax had been deducted,
amounted to 130,000 <em>yen</em> (£13,000).”</p>

<p>“How is it you have avoided the master-passion of
our London actors to become an actor-manager?”</p>

<p>“I think a manager must be sorely tempted to put
money first and art second. I often advise authors to
make certain alterations in the plays for which I am
engaged, but the responsibility of entire management
would distract me from the purely artistic aspect of
representation.”</p>

<p>A mischievous recollection of Delobelle’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je n’ai
pas le droit de renoncer à mon art</span>” occurred to me,
and I cynically wondered whether management might
not diminish (it could hardly increase) the lion’s share
of the receipts.</p>

<p>“Will you ask Mr. Danjuro,” I said, “if he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
like to put any questions to me about European actors
and acting? I shall be most delighted to give him
information on the subject.”</p>

<p>The answer was a blank negative. For the patriotic
actor no stage existed but his own. He had
never been abroad; his interest in foreign things was
limited to the flattering curiosity of foreign admirers.</p>

<p>The interview had already lasted an hour, for the
translation of question and answer from concise English
into more elaborate Japanese, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>, was
a rather slow process. I therefore begged the invaluable
Kishimoto to say that I could not think of
trespassing any longer on Mr. Danjuro’s leisure, and
would spare him one or two other interrogations which
had suggested themselves. Thanking him in my best
Japanese, I was rising to go, but our unwearied host
would not hear of it, and insisted on my continuing to
the bitter end.</p>

<p>“Well, since you are so kind, I should much like to
hear your opinion of the <em>sōshi shibai</em>.”</p>

<p>Knowing that the <em>sōshi</em>-theatre must appear to a
conservative actor as red a rag as the Independent
Theatre to Mr. Clement Scott or the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre de
l’Œuvre</span> to the late M. Sarcey, I awaited the reply
with interest. But the gallant attempt to destroy
feudal spectacular drama with ammunition drawn from
French and English arsenals had failed so miserably,
that the patriot could afford to be generous.
His eyes twinkled as he answered: “Certainly some
of the <em>sōshi</em> had great talent, but it was all of the
theoretic kind. They had splendid theories about
reforming the stage and bringing it into harmony with
progress, with the spirit of the age, and other fine
things. But, when they had to translate their theories
into practice, the result fell very far short of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
aims. Their writers were amateurs, their actors were
amateurs; they knew nothing of stage-craft. The
public, excited by the promises, were willing enough
to give them a trial, but, as they did not know how to
interest the public&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you gave them no assistance, Mr. Danjuro?”</p>

<p>“None at all.”</p>

<p>“Are you blessed with a censor of plays?”</p>

<p>“There is a censorship, but it falls under the head
of ordinary police duties, and is not specially limited
to the theatre. Political and licentious passages are
carefully excised before performance, and I doubt if
the authority of the censor has been exercised in the
Meiji era (since the Restoration).”</p>

<p>“How is it that foreign plays fail to interest your
playgoers?”</p>

<p>It is my honest belief that Kishimoto, from a mistaken
idea of sparing my feelings, abridged considerably
the answer to this question. Both he and
Mr. Danjuro chuckled a great deal, and seemed to be
exchanging sympathetic affirmations. Then came the
crushing rejoinder: “Because in all your plays the
attitude of men to women seems to us not only irrational
but ridiculous.”</p>

<p>I changed the subject. “Which classes go most to
the theatre?”</p>

<p>“The middle and lower classes. Since the Emperor
witnessed a performance in Count Inonyé’s house in
1886 it has become more fashionable for men of rank
to go occasionally, but it cannot be said that the
aristocracy, as a class, patronise the stage.”</p>

<p>“Can Mr. Danjuro tell me if the <em>mawari-butai</em>, or
revolving stage, resembling what the Greeks used to
call <em>eccyclema</em>, is native or imported? Some Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
have told me that it was probably adopted from a
foreign source.” Mr. Danjuro held the opposite opinion.</p>

<p>“And how far is your stage controlled by guilds?”</p>

<p>“The old system has entirely broken down. Formerly
some six or seven families had complete control
of the theatre. A novice could only enter the profession
through adoption by one or other of these. He
received an elaborate education; he adopted the name
and a modified form of the crest of his patron. The
right to play certain parts was vested in certain actors,
who transmitted the privilege. But now all that is
changed. Any one can go on the stage and play any
part he likes. There is no restriction and no training
either.”</p>

<p>“And is the special tax on actors now abolished,
giving place to an income-tax?”</p>

<p>“No; that is an error. We still pay a heavy tax,
irrespective of income.”</p>

<p>“One more question. Have you any association
corresponding to that which in England is known by
the name of the Actors’ Benevolent Fund?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we have a large guild, which undertakes to
help members overtaken by misfortune and to expel
others whose actions bring discredit on the stage. For
we love our art, and are rewarded by its growing
popularity with all classes of the community.”</p>

<p>On this patriotic note I thought it well to close. I
urged Kishimoto to exhaust his stock of honorifics in
a suitable vote of thanks, and, as I took leave of the
patient, archiepiscopal veteran, I wondered how a
mosquito feels when it has been stinging with impertinent
curiosity, hour after hour, some grave, immemorial
image of Buddha.</p>

<p class="noindent">In Europe she wears black. That colour is better
suited to the ignoble tragedy of which she is both
heroine and victim. At night you may see her hovering
furtively about the edge of a square, where shadows
hang darkest, or plucking at passers-by with words of
vulgar endearment. All she has to offer is momentary
pasture for the teeth of desire, since love and confidence,
the lanterns of happy wedlock, shed no light on her
outcast bed. Society damns, but cannot destroy, her.
Shame and solitude are the wages which corrode her
soul even more rapidly than her body, though that has
become in Christian eyes, as the poet so finely says,
“a blasphemy, brandished like a torch before God”;
but man, denying her the status of any but an unconvicted
criminal, forces her to drop lower and lower
through remorse and infamy to the hospital-pallet or
the assassin’s knife.</p>

<p>How different is her fortune in Japan! There she
wears scarlet, garish and bright as the five years’
revelry to which, as they might sell a platter or a cup,
her parents have sold her; but she is not doomed to
the black degradation which robs her Western sister of
self-respect. Though the loss of freedom be irksome
and submission to buyers disagreeable, yet she is a
member of “the oldest profession in the world,” in a
country where it is not without honour. She is surrounded
by companions, well fed and well housed,
protected from robbery or murder by the Government
and the goddess Inari; above all, she does not live
ashamed and boycotted, but plays her part in an active
round of duties and ceremonies. If remembered precepts
of religious teaching ever visit her, they come, not
to threaten, but to console. So far from slipping hell-wards,
she is earning the approbation which Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
accords to filial self-sacrifice. Happy she is not,
though she may one day become so, for, when her
contract shall have expired, marriage will be no
impossibility. But she is much less unhappy than if
she wore black.</p>

<p>It might be thought that the operation of natural
laws, regulating supply and demand, would sufficiently
account for her existence. But those who prefer fancy
to fact are given the choice between two legends.
According to one, the Emperor Komatsu Tenno sent
forth his eight daughters to be women of pleasure and
set the fashion in seven provinces; from them the
courtesans of Settsu, Hiogo, and Eguchi were said to
be descended. Though one may doubt the authenticity
of this imperial origin, the incongruity between rank
and the exercise of the scarlet profession did not affect
the Eastern mind, as it does our minds, with a sense of
repulsion. On the contrary, it is no uncommon thing
in the old romances to find a heroine of noble birth
resorting, reluctantly indeed, but without any feeling of
irremediable guilt, to the sale of her charms, until she
should find a chance of regaining liberty and her lover.
In fact, one of the classes into which courtesans were
divided, that of <em>tsubone-jōro</em>, was so called from the
word <em>tsubone</em>, signifying the ladies’ apartments in a
Daimyō’s house, because the daughter of Ichinomiya, a
Daimyō, being driven by stress of weather to Hiroshima
and by want of money to sell her favours, became
prototype and founder of aristocratic demireps. The
country-folk, respecting her station, would not reckon
her among common <em>jōro</em>, but prefixed the substantive
<em>tsubone</em> rather than blur their nice appreciation of
class distinction. The second legend sounds less
apocryphal. After the great sea-fight of Dan-no-ura<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in 1185, the widows and daughters of the defeated
Taira clan “were forced for daily bread to sell their
bodies in the streets of Shimonoseki.” But at least
four centuries before that date the Hetaira had begun
to set her mark on history and literature.</p>

<p>The poetry of the Nara period, which reflects the
elegant court-culture of the eighth century and is represented
by Manyōshiu (“The Collection of One Thousand
Leaves”), was largely written by women, and
contains at least one song by a “jūgyōjōfu,” or “woman
who goes about for pleasure.” The <em>kugutsu</em>, who
were summoned by innkeepers for the convenience of
guests and were of much lower status, composed many
famous little songs, whose memory has survived that of
their authors. But the first light-o’-love whose orb
burns brightly on the stormy darkness of the twelfth
century, when Taira and Minamoto deluged the rice-fields
with blood, was Tora Gozen. The most beautiful
courtesan in Oiso, she became the mistress of the elder
Soga, who slew his father’s murderer in the hunting
camp of the Shōgun Yoritomo at the foot of Fuji.
Their tale is told in an historical novel, “Soga Monogatari,”
and the tourist who descends from the sulphur-springs
of Ashinoyu to Lake Hakone will still pass on
his way three monuments of stone, the smallest being
commemorative of Tora. More striking still is the
tribute paid to Takao, another type of immortal frailty,
who refused with scorn the Lord of Sendai’s offer to
become his property. Endowed with every accomplishment,
she enjoyed a higher social position than
the geisha of those days, and regaining her freedom,
was faithful (so far as professional exigencies would
allow) to a lover of humble rank. Not only has her
native hamlet of Shiogama erected a memorial-stone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
honour her dishonour, but the priests of the little
Myō-onji temple jealously guard a faded fragment of
her wardrobe. There was never great hostility in
Japan between the goddess of love and more ascetic
deities. In more than one locality you will find a
row of temples fronted by a row of pleasure-houses,
that the pilgrims may impartially indulge body and
soul.</p>

<p>When the Ashikaga Shōguns made Kyōto a centre
of nobler art and more delicate refinement, the Scarlet
Lady lost ground. The curse of Confucius, stigmatising
her sex, had crossed the Yellow Sea. Painters
preferred the beauty of snow and tree and bird to her
fatal beauty; poets, imbued with Buddhism, wrote
passion-plays on other passions than hers. Neither in
the serious <em>Nō</em> nor comical <em>Kiōgen</em> does she cut any
figure at all. It would almost seem that for two
centuries men found ceremonial tea-drinking and the
excitements of civil war more congenial than her
society.</p>

<p>At last the queen came by her own. When the
feudal nobles went down before Iyeyasu and took his
iron yoke upon their necks, the military despot was
seen to be a popular liberator. Art and literature
ceased to be the precious playthings of an æsthetic
aristocracy. Novelists, playwrights, painters rose
from the masses and worked for the masses. Rejecting
in scorn the moony fetters of Chinese convention,
they painted in broad colours and aimed at broad
effects. Yedo, the new capital, without culture and
without traditions, became their home and their hunting-ground.
Of these turbulent subjects Venus Pandemos
was naturally queen, and since her accession in the
seventeenth century to the present day many measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of restraint, more or less fruitless, have been adopted
by scandalised authority to curb her sovereignty.</p>

<p>As for the novelists, three great names in Japanese
fiction may be cited at once. Saikaku, who died at
Osaka in 1693, wrote an enormous number of amusing
stories and sketches of contemporary life. The rollicking
life of the gay lupanars was his favourite theme.
Mr. Aston assures us that “the very titles are too
gross for quotation.” Even his contemporaries were
shocked, and a virulent criticism, entitled “Saikaku in
Hell,” brought about the suppression of his works by
the Government. A new edition has lately been permitted
to appear. In the next century his example
was followed and bettered by Jishō, whose name
signifies “Spontaneous Laughter.” He was a Kyōto
publisher, and his place of business, the Hachimoniji-ya,
or Figure Eight House, was as popular in its day with
lovers of sex-novels as the Bodley Head itself. He
had a collaborator, called Kesiki; and whether he
supplied the humour and Kesiki the psychology I
cannot say, but their joint productions aimed at something
higher than Rabelaisian mirth. They aspired
to the laurels of Theophrastus, delineating “Types of
Elderly Men,” “Types of Merchants’ Assistants,”
“Types of Girlhood,” and the like. But whatever
the type selected, the reader was sure to pass most of
his time with it in fast society. Well, Spontaneous
Laughter died, but his firm continued to publish <em>sharebon</em>,
or witty books, until the end of the eighteenth
century, when once more the authorities swooped
down and made an end. The fame of both these
novelists is eclipsed by that of Kiōden (1761&ndash;1861),
the father of the romantic novel. His predecessors
had made men titter, but he bade them shudder or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
weep, at the harlot’s fate. He proved the sincerity of
his sympathy with women of that class by marrying
two of them in succession. They are said to have
been excellent wives. At the age of thirty he was
“condemned to fifty days’ handcuffs (in his own
house),” for circulating what he called an “Edifying
Story-book.” His subsequent stories were mostly
founded on less dangerous themes.</p>

<p>If any should suppose that the writers of stories and
plays on this subject had no other purpose than to
supply unwholesome food for unclean appetites, he
would be egregiously mistaken. The author of a
witty book might indeed be liable to this imputation,
though the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> attitude of his fellow-countrymen to
physical facts which it is our habit to ignore robs
the pat epithet “pornographic” of much opprobrium.
Still there were limits of propriety, which, in his zeal
to amuse, he frequently left behind. But the dramatist
had every justification for dramatising the Unfortunate
Lady, who appealed most strongly to his imagination
and his heart. To begin with, his audience loved a
spectacle, and what spectacular setting could dazzle
them more than the spacious Kuruwa with its balconied
palaces, divided by cherry-trees and hung with showy
lanterns? What other section of society could provide
such a feast of colour for beauty-loving eyes as these
priestesses of pleasure, when they moved in procession
through thronging suitors in their gorgeous sweeping
robes, or sat superbly immobile, like painted idols,
their high <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffures</i> haloed with radiating pins of pearl
and silver and tortoise-shell? And beneath all that
picturesque elegance throbbed a tragic, adventurous
existence. Other women passed silently from father
to husband, from mother to mother-in-law, their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
arranged for them on lines of tranquil duty. But the
Unfortunate Lady, transferred in girlhood, a chattel or
a heroine, from village poverty to urban splendour,
becoming half a queen and half a slave, was both free
and not free to follow the voice of passion, which her
secluded sisters had often never heard. They slept
peacefully, with nothing to greatly hope or fear from
the hand of destiny, but to her at any moment might
come a Perseus, cleaving the dragon’s mail with
golden sword and delivering Andromeda from deadly
servitude. Out of the hundreds of plays devoted
to Andromeda, I will recall one, which has sunk
most deeply into popular favour, and which I saw
enacted before a weeping audience at the Kabuki-za
theatre.</p>

<p>His name was not Perseus, but Gompachi, and he is
supposed to have lived no more than two hundred and
fifty years ago&mdash;the hero of this typical romance. He
had the misfortune at the age of sixteen to kill one of
his relations in a quarrel about a dog, and was obliged
to flee for refuge to the capital. On his way to Yedo he
was roused at midnight from his bed at a wayside inn
by a beautiful girl, who warned him that a band of
robbers, having stolen her from her parents, intended
to slay him and steal his sword before daybreak. This
was not Andromeda, but Komurasaki. As in duty
bound, the gallant <em>samurai</em> cut down the whole band
and restored their captive to her father, a wealthy
merchant, who, for his part, asked nothing better than
to marry his daughter to so dashing a youth. But
this would have been against all precedent. For
Andromeda to rescue Perseus and bestow on him the
hand of a prospective heiress would have been to
reverse the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôles</i> in a most unbecoming manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Gompachi, therefore, setting ambition before love,
pursued his way to Yedo. There he fell into dissolute
habits, and, some years after, hearing much talk of a
new beauty in Yoshiwara, discovered her to be no
other than Komurasaki. Her family had fallen into
dire poverty, and, to alleviate their sufferings, she had
become an inmate of the huge metropolitan pleasure-house.
This time Andromeda was in her proper
place, the helpless victim of a ruthless monster, but to
strike off her manacles a golden sword was needed,
and this Perseus found it difficult to obtain. He took
to robbery, which again involved murder, for his own
fortune was far too meagre to allow of frequent meetings,
far less of redeeming his sweetheart. At last he
was caught and beheaded as a common malefactor,
before he could compass his mission, and Komurasaki,
accomplishing her own salvation, stabbed herself to
death upon his tomb. If you should visit Meguro,
about four miles west of Tōkyō, when the peonies are
in bloom, you will have no trouble in ascertaining the
position of their grave. It is called <em>Hiyoku-zuka</em> after
the Hiyoku, “a fabulous double bird, which is an
emblem of constancy in love.”</p>

<p>Tragedies of this romantic character were very
frequent in the Yedo period, though they generally
ended in <em>shinju</em>, the simultaneous suicide of girl and
guest, who thus hoped to enter on new life together.
In fact, so frequent were they in the Genroku and
Shōtoku eras (1688&ndash;1715), that the authorities tried
to rob this death of attraction by cruel indignities to
the dead. The bodies were exposed to view for
three days on Nihon-bashi, hands and feet being tied
together. Then the <em>Eta</em>, social pariahs, wrapped them
in straw matting and cast them into a pit. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
thought that after such a dog’s burial their ghosts
would not return to haunt the living, but it was customary
to make their story into a song, which would
become a nine days’ pathos in Asakusa.</p>

<p>Not pathos but majesty is the dominating note of
the Ukiyoye painters’ homage to their Madonna. Easy
to recognise by her distinctive garb&mdash;the tall <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffure</i>,
transfixed with branching pins, the reversed sash with
satchel-like bow in front, the high clogs of black
lacquer&mdash;she is by far the most familiar figure to
Western eyes through the medium of plebeian art.
Cheap colour-prints, disseminated her image from
Boston to Paris; enthusiasts gave eager eye to her
hieratic grace. Utamaro, who openly lived in Yoshiwara,
which he served with purse and brush, was the
first to win French homage through De Goncourt’s
advocacy for his stately mistresses of preternatural
height. Daintier and more human, but not less
divine, the monochromatic ladies of Moronobu, the
green-and-rose ladies of Kiyonobu, the sirens beloved
of Kiyonaga, of Toyokuni, of Kunisada, followed one
another round the world, encircling it with a Circean
spell. Banish their portraits from the collector’s
gallery, and you leave it bare of three or four of the
greatest names on the roll of Tōkyō artists. On the
other hand, you will more easily defend the Japanolater’s
thesis, that part of the superiority of Japanese
over Occidental art lies in its contempt for the “eternal
feminine.”</p>

<p>It was Iyeyasu, the great organiser, who made it
part of the State’s business to centralise and control
sporadic vice in the capital. Before his time the
“social evil,” as it is called, was free to spread its virus
where it might, to the hurt of private and public weal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
But one day, as the conqueror was returning from the
battle of Sekigahara and taking his lease in the tea-house
of Shoji Jinyemon, at Shinagawa, the proprietor,
whose efforts to please were seconded by eight red-aproned
waitresses of unusual beauty, so impressed the
Shōgun with his talent for that kind of management,
that he was appointed <em>nanushi</em>, or director-in-chief,
of the Moto-Yoshiwara, founded in response to many
petitions in 1618. Into this quarter, which either took
its name from Yoshiwara, a town on the Tokaido
famed for the prettiness of its daughters, or from its
literal import, the “place of reeds,” being situated in a
marsh on the outskirts of Yedo, all the courtesans
who had infested various portions of the city were
gathered, licensed, and supervised. It at once became
a little city in itself, wisely and usefully administered,
and, being burnt down fifty years later, was replaced
by the new or Shin-Yoshiwara, which remains in
most essentials to this day a copy of its predecessor.
It was divided into eight wards, each of which had
responsible recorders, whose duty was to keep order,
to guard against fires, and report suspicious characters
to the police. Policemen stood at the gates, and every
guest was required to enter his name in a register,
though he might disguise it by changing the characters,
if it were phonetically correct. At one time
Christians and gamblers were forbidden to enter,
while the <em>samurai</em>, or military retainer, whose Roman
discipline excluded visits to Capua, was provided by the
Amigasa tea-houses with a large braid hat to conceal
his features. Espionage, as always under the Tokugawa
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, was a pronounced feature of this autonomous
system, which was, and still is, of immense
service in the detection of crime, since ill-gotten gains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
were generally disbursed in that locality, affording clues
to the identity of their possessor.</p>

<p>The organisation of each house, or <em>kashi-zashiki</em>,
was elaborate and peculiar. The master, or <em>teishu</em>,
though compelled to live on the premises, was seldom
visible. His was the unseen hand which directed
and received. He engaged at least three <em>wakaimono</em>
(young fellows), supplied to him by a detective
agency, of whom the <em>banto</em>, or clerk, made purchases
and kept accounts; the <em>mise-ban</em>, or lady’s attendant,
walked behind her with open umbrella to avert sun
or rain, when she passed in procession through the
main street, Naka-no-cho; the <em>nikai-ma-washi</em>, or
upper-storey man, looked to the lamps, the bedding,
and other details of domestic comfort. Beside these
were messengers, gardeners, bath-men, cooks, and
night-watchman, who hailed the advent of each
nocturnal hour with noisy wooden clappers. The
staff of female assistants varied with the status of the
house. If the girls belonged to the highest class,
called <em>taiyu</em> or <em>oiran</em>, to each was allotted two child
attendants, <em>kamuro</em>, whose dress must be of white
bleached linen, decorated with a pine-tree pattern and
crossed on the left shoulder by a black cape bearing
in gold letters their mistress’s name. When these
little girls reached the age of fourteen, if their parents
so wished it, they became <em>furisode shinzo</em>, or <em>shinzo</em>
with flowing sleeves, and, without altogether ceasing
to be attendants, began to learn the arts of singing,
and arranging flowers and making tea. Yet a third
class of servants bore the name of <em>banshin</em>. These
were generally discharged <em>jōro</em>, who wore striped
crape with a sash of black satin, and had the right to
refuse admission to any whose respectability appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
doubtful. But the most powerful and most unpopular
person in the whole establishment was named <em>Yarité</em>,
or Spear-Hand. She was responsible for the behaviour
of all under her charge, and might administer
corporal punishment. If a girl were summoned before
the local justice, it was she who escorted her and
answered the questions of the judge. Her room faced
the top of the staircase, and none could pass to the
inner chambers without propitiating the dragon on
the threshold.</p>

<p>But to pass from the inner chambers to the world
without the Yoshiwara was rarely permitted to such
closely guarded prisoners. The prison might be
known as the “House of the Myriad Flowers,” or the
“House of the Eight Banners,” or the “House of the
Ten Thousand Plums,” but it was none the less a
prison. Not one of its inmates, neither “Evening
Mist,” nor “Filmy Cloud,” nor the “Face of Evening,”
could glide imperceptibly from its vigilant constraint.
If her parents were dangerously ill and lived not too
far away, a girl was sometimes allowed to visit them,
being given a label, which she must return at sunset.
If she were ill herself, she might consult a doctor outside
the quarter; and all had the privilege of going in
a party to Mukōjima in the season of cherry-blossom.
But no other <em>exeat</em> was accorded. A runaway was
invariably caught, and the expenses of capture were
deducted from her subsequent earnings. At the age
of twenty-five she was sure of regaining her liberty.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the five years’ durance
were years of unrelieved servitude. As month followed
month, the monotony was broken by a round
of kindly festivals. On New Year’s Day the whole
household was assembled by Spear-Hand to pay conventional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
compliments to the master and mistress,
who requited this courtesy with handsome presents.
Every <em>jōro</em> received two dresses of silk crape; every
<em>shinzo</em> two of pongee; every child attendant a dress
of white linen with pine-tree pattern. Branches of
pine and bamboo were suspended from the entrance,
and above the lintels of the door-posts flamed a scarlet
lobster. On each associated tea-house were bestowed
<em>saké</em> cups of <em>kiri</em> wood, stamped with the donor’s
crest. At least three grand processions were held to
celebrate the planting of the flowers. In April, when
cherry-blossom was set before the tea-houses and
along the main-street of Naka-no-cho, the balconies
were crowded with spectators, the doorways hung
with cherry-coloured curtains, as the stately line of
magnificently-attired beauties with their attendant
children and umbrella-bearers moved slowly on its
way to the temple of Inari. In June, when iris was
planted, the heavily-wadded dresses were laid aside,
and lightly robed, like winged zephyrs, as though to
personify their names, “White Cloud,” and “A Thousand
Springs,” and “The Smell of the Plum Blossom”
would pass with all their fanciful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</i> through the
sun-lit Place of Reeds.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verseq">“It ver et Venus, et veris prænuntius ante</p>
<p class="verse">Pennatus graditur Zephyrus, vestigia propter</p>
<p class="verse">Flora quibus mater præspargens ante viaï</p>
<p class="verse">Cuncta coloribus egregiis et odoribus opplet.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">October brought chrysanthemum and signalised the
close of summer. The imperial blossom soaked in
<em>saké</em> was eaten on the ninth day; the big <em>hibachi</em> were
lit; the human butterflies took a last flutter through
the streets, their frail wings sheathed in velvet and
brocade against the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Other festivals, more intimate than these, assuaged
the rigour of imprisonment. Though Inari had four
temples in which to welcome her votaries, other divinities,
too, offered distraction and consolation. When
the evil spirits had been exorcised on the fourteenth
day of the first month, the field was clear to
garner divine favour. Ebisu, the jovial, pot-bellied
god of good luck, claimed his meed of fish and <em>saké</em>;
the sacred monkey-dance preceded the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> of Inari;
Tanabata, the star of happy marriage, was warmly
greeted with poems and fans and paper stars, which
budded on bamboo branches fastened to the door;
the feast of lanterns lasted a month, flooding the
dark with radiance, but on the evening sacred to the
memory of ancestors no guests were admitted, and the
girls were free to hold communion with those parental
dead whose exigence pressed so hardly on their
flower-sweet heyday of life. Then O Tsuki San, the
Lady Moon, must be “looked at” on three successive
nights, while persimmon, rice dumplings, boiled beans,
and chestnuts were set outside the house on tiny
tripods, to catch her auspicious rays. On the occasion
of the annual fire-incantation oranges were scattered
about the garden and scrambled for by children, and
three weeks before the year ended came the great
cleaning, the preparation of rice-cakes and countless
emblems for New Year’s Day.</p>

<p>The observance of <em>oyaku</em>, when one of the little
girls in waiting became a Shinzo with flowing sleeves,
involved much expense for the <em>anejōro</em> to whose
service she had been attached. First <em>ohaguro</em>, to
blacken her teeth, was collected from seven friends;
presents were made of buckwheat and red beans and
rice to the tea-houses which they had visited together;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a row of cooking vessels, filled with steaming food, was
covered with lengths of silk crape and damask outside
the house, while indoors a table was set out with fans,
tobacco-pouches, and embroidered towels for the geisha
and servants. For three days the newly promoted
damsel would promenade the Naka-no-cho, wearing on
the first day a long red cloak, on the second a purple
cloak, on the third one of pale blue. The coiffure
also varied from day to day, and the total expense of
this ceremonious coming of age varied from twenty to
forty pounds.</p>

<p>Occasionally it would happen that a guest fell in
love with a girl and wished to marry her. Such a
consummation was the object of many vows to Inari
and the subject of many poems addressed to the Star
of the Weaver at the festival of Tanabata. If he
could raise the sum of 600 <em>ryo</em> (about £60), the rest
was easy. Debts had to be paid, innumerable gifts
conferred on patrons, companions, and attendants, of
whom farewell was taken at a great feast on the day
of departure. It requires much suffering and evil
influence to uproot from the heart of any Japanese
woman the flowers of gratitude and affection. If
tradition may be credited, more than one suitor who
anticipated Aubrey Tanqueray’s experiment was rewarded
for his courage with a happier fate. When
the heavy black gate clanged behind her, happy
indeed was the Scarlet Lady to put off her state-robes
and become the obscure angel of a long-prayed-for
benefactor. Sometimes she turned out badly. In that
case the husband had the right to send her back,
wearing a gown of penitential grey, to finish out her
term in Yoshiwara.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent">How much colour had been washed out of the foregoing
picture by Western disapproval, filtering through
merchants and missionaries, I was curious to learn.
To their credit or discredit be it said, none of my
Tōkyō friends cared to visit the Shin-Yoshiwara in the
company of an alien. They were not exactly hindered
by moral scruples, but rather by a disinclination to
disclose the seamy side of their fellow-countrymen
to censorious eyes. They professed ignorance and
changed the subject to railways or ironclads. However,
one evening I met by chance the secretary of a
famous lawyer-politician, who was taking a country
cousin to see the sights of the capital; and, as he
obligingly invited me to join the party, we made our
way together through the maze of variety-shows and
toy-shops which surround the Temple of Kwannon at
Asakusa, until we reached the high embankment of
Nihon-tsutsumi.</p>

<p>As we stood on the great dyke in a whirr of hurrying
rickshaws, the country on the outer side stretched
away into darkness, like the waste tracks which border
the northern exterior boulevards of Paris. But at our
feet, brilliant with light and clamorous with <em>samisens</em>,
lay a clustering mass of lofty buildings, their roofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
adorned with wooden seven-pronged rakes, which I
had seen so often in old prints and knew to be emblems
of good luck, purchased in November by pious traders
from the priests of the Temple of the Eagle.</p>

<p>We walked down the slope of Emonzaka (the hill
of the collar), which perhaps took its name from the
habit of the Tōkyō blood to adjust the <em>kimono</em> collar
in careful folds at the moment of entry, and traversed
Gojikken-machi, the street of fifty tea-houses leading
to the ponderous gate, where two dapper policemen,
neatly gloved and sworded, kept watch and ward.
Now we are between handsome edifices, four storeys
high, adorned with balconies and electric light, in the
broad central Naka-no-cho, which three narrow turnings
intersect on either side, containing shops of less
imposing dimensions. The upper storeys tell no tales,
though their paper-panelled shutters give twinkling
and tinkling signs of revelry. On the ground-floor is
an unbroken series of shop-windows, not fronted with
plate-glass as in Piccadilly nor open to the street as
in the Ginza, but palisaded with wooden bars from
three to seven inches wide. And behind the bars, on
silk or velvet cushions against a gaudy background of
draped mirrors and ornamental woodwork, sit the
wares&mdash;a row of powdered, painted, exquisitely
upholstered victims. Most of them look happy
enough, as they chatter or smoke or run laughing to
the barrier to greet a passing acquaintance, but I
know what heroic endurance is masked by a Japanese
smile, and the sight of caged women turns me sick.
Then I reflect that Western sentiment, however
justified by inherited ethics, is scarcely the best
auxiliary of fair judgment, so, striving to convert my
conscience to a camera, I follow my companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
through the strange avenue of animated dolls. If
they were really dolls of cunning fabrication, how
much more readily could one inspect and appraise
them! It seems that the most costly are reserved
for their own compatriots. An English painter was,
indeed, permitted to begin the portrait of one of these,
but, when he came back to finish his work, admittance
was refused. It was easy to believe that the inmates
of the best houses were socially superior to the rest,
for those whom I saw had gentle, refined faces, and
did not raise their eyes from book or embroidery.</p>

<p>The least expensive dolls’ houses&mdash;they were of
four grades&mdash;were decorated in execrable taste, and
the Circes who cried or beckoned from their red-and-gilt
dens had harsh voices and were of ungainly build.
But between these extremes were some groups of
prettily dressed exhibits, whose rich yet sober colouring
harmonised admirably with the vision of whatever
artist had been invited to decorate their show-room.
There was the House of the Well of the Long Blooming
Flowers, which should have been isolated for sheer
loveliness from its flaunting neighbours. Behind the
motionless houri, whose bright black tresses and mauve
<em>kimono</em> were starred with white flowers, ran a riot
of branch and blossom on wall and screen. Had
Mohammed been Japanese, here was a tableau to win
believers with the lure of a sensual paradise, but for
the fact that, having realised so material a heaven on
earth, the most inquisitive nation in the world would
have demanded less familiar felicity. Beautiful, too,
was the House of the Three Sea-shores, whose triple
tide of waveless blue seemed silently advancing to
reclaim the mermaid-daughters of Benten, who waited
in such pathetic patience on the beach for a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Urashima. My fancy was most taken by the House of
the Dragon Cape, for the ancient ferocity of the saurian
symbol, wrought in dusky bronze, not only fascinated
with its boldness of coil and curve, but hovered with
appropriate cruelty over the meek prisoners, coquettishly
disguised. By the time we arrived at the lair
of the Dragon I was thoroughly tired. We had been
tramping and gazing for more than an hour at nearly
two thousand replicas of the same figure, watching its
movements and conjecturing its feelings. The cages
were beginning to empty, as the more attractive centre-pieces
found purchasers. I detected a certain impatience
in my companions’ bearing, and I was on the
point of taking leave of them when the secretary
suggested that, if I would like to enter the Dragon-house
and take notes of the interior, he would explain
my mission to the proprietor.</p>

<p>It was needful to release three damsels from the
public gaze if we would enter, and this we cheerfully
did, bidding Young Bamboo, Golden Harp, and
River of Song escape to their chambers. Then,
leaving our shoes in charge of bowing attendants, we
climbed to the first floor and began the evening with
a mild tea-party. The Shinzo, in black dresses, brought
in lacquer trays, on which were scarlet bowls containing
eggs, fish, soup, and other delicacies. <em>Saké</em> flowed
more copiously than tea. I was sorry to hear that
the old-time processions were falling into disuse, and,
though not yet abandoned entirely, were losing their
antique splendour. The <em>taiyu</em>, too, was a thing of
the past. The aureole of combs, the manifold robe
over robe, the child attendants, had all gone. Varying
now only in costume and accomplishment, all the
women alike were cage-dwellers, whereas in former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
days the superior classes of them were spared that
indignity. So far from evading questions, the presiding
representative of Spear-hand, an elderly woman
with a not unkindly face, seemed amused by my interest
and answered readily. I began to think we had made
a mistake. This decorous tea-party, removed from
the glare and hustle of the street, bore small resemblance
to an orgy. But now and then wild incidents
surged up in the low ripple of current gossip. Six
months before a fire had broken out in Ageyamachi,
consuming half an alley of too contiguous wooden
dwellings and costing twenty lives. Recently a brawl
between Russian sailors and Tōkyō students had
fluttered all the dovecots of Sami Cho, but had been
speedily quenched by the fearless dapper police.</p>

<p>A sound of thrumming from the floor above hinted
that the next item on the programme would be
musical. We mounted and found ourselves in presence
of two geisha, Miss Wistaria and Miss Dolly,
who had been summoned by my cicerone while I was
interrogating the Shinzo. The status and performance
of these geisha differ considerably from those of
their more respectable sisters, and Europeans, by confusing
the two, have no doubt helped to affix a stigma
to the whole class. Miss Dolly was no more than a
child, and Miss Wistaria looked about sixteen. Both
songs and dances, without being vulgar, were decidedly
lax; and, as the songs were topical, I followed them
less easily than the dance, which might have been
named after a primitive Japanese goddess, “The
Female who Invites.” Yet I must confess that the
indelicacy was not blatant, but redeemed by a coy
conscientiousness as of one who, half laughing, half
shrinking, complies with an inevitable command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
After some forty minutes of minstrelsy (my companions
joining in the songs), the entertainment concluded
with a polite request to the “honourable
stranger” to return, and, handing us their cards&mdash;dainty
cardlets, one inch square, inscribed with tiny
hieroglyphics&mdash;the performers returned to the tea-house
whence they had been hired.</p>

<p>At this moment Young Bamboo, Golden Harp, and
River of Song, whom I had completely forgotten,
reappeared on the scene. They had changed their
scarlet robes for looser ones of white satin, and awaited
our pleasure. I explained to River of Song, whose
intelligent expression had influenced my choice, that if
she would tell me her story and describe her impressions
of Yoshiwara life, her duties would be at an end
and her fee doubled. Entering readily into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i>
of Scheherazadé, she began by declaring that, though
eagerly awaiting the day of liberation, which was yet
two years off, she was not so unhappy as many of her
companions. At first, when the bell rang before the
shrine at evening for a signal to enter the cage (<em>mise</em>,
“the shop,” she called it), the ordeal was both long
and painful. But time had assuaged this feeling, and
she had made many friends. Moreover, the Spear-hand
of Dragon Cape had taken a fancy to her and
made her life easier. Then she recalled her childhood.
Her real name was Miss Mushroom (Matsutaké), and
her father had been a fisherman of Shinagawa. Ever
since she could remember, it had been her habit to
patter bare-footed along the beach and gather shellfish
at low tide. But bad times drove her parents into
Tōkyō, where an uncle had a small shop in the main
street of Asakusa. On him they built their hopes, but
his business failed, her mother died, and at last the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
father, hoping to make a fresh start by capitalising his
daughter, sold her to the house of the Dragon Cape.
At this point I asked if I could see the <em>nenki-shomon</em>,
or certificate of sale, which would probably be in the
possession of Spear-hand. The River of Song hesitated,
not liking to ask, but I volunteered to accompany
her, and we finished the story in the actual sanctum of
Spear-hand, whom I had propitiated with coins and
cigarettes.</p>

<p>The document (except in the matter of names) was
thus worded:</p>

<div class="fs80 pad6">
<p class="noindent"><em>Name of Girl</em>&mdash;Ito Matsutaké.<br />

<em>Age</em>&mdash;Eighteen years.<br />

<em>Dwelling-place</em>&mdash;Asakusa, Daimachi 18.<br />

<em>Father’s name</em>&mdash;Ito Nobuta.</p>
</div>

<div class="fs80 pad2">
<p>You, Minami Kakichi, proprietor of the House of the Dragon
Cape, agree to take into your employ for five years the above named
at a price of:&mdash;</p>

<p>300 <em>yen</em> (about £30).</p>

<p>30 <em>yen</em> (about £3) you retain as <em>mizukin</em> (allowance for dress).</p>

<p>270 <em>yen</em> (about £27), the balance, I have received.</p>

<p>I guarantee that the girl will not cause you trouble while in your
employ.</p>

<p>She is of the Monto sect, her temple being the Higashi Hongwanji
in Asakusa.</p>
</div>

<div class="fs80 pad6">
<p class="noindent"><em>Parent’s name</em>&mdash;Ito Nobuta.<br />

<em>Witness’s name</em>&mdash;Kimoto Nagao.<br />

<em>Landlord’s name</em>&mdash;Yamada Isoh.<br />

<em>Proprietor’s name</em>&mdash;Minami Kakichi.<br />

<em>Name of Kashi-zashiki</em>&mdash;House of the Dragon Cape.</p>
</div>

<p>It seemed to me that this certificate was story
enough, with its batch of red seals denoting the triple
sanction of father, master, and gods. Yet was it not
better so? Hard as her fate might be, these were
regular sponsors of a legal profession. She was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
living in lonely defiance of public opinion and private
remorse. She would still be gentle, submissive,
modest, until the lapse of time should restore her
liberty, unless the rascaldom that would beset her
pathway for five long years should coarsen and undo
her natural goodness. The Japanese used to boast
that they were born good; that only the Chinese, and
such barbarians, require a code of prohibitive clauses
defining and forbidding sin. It is a charming theory,
and many foreigners have subscribed to it. It is
certain that if you deduct from Yoshiwara the heinousness
which Western moralists impute, a tangle of pros
and cons would confuse the Japanese conservative
who knows anything of Western wickedness. But, as
I wavered to the sentimental side of Oriental legality,
seduced by the condoning circumstances of politeness
and security, I suddenly remembered that this city of
pleasure was founded upon a marsh, for all night long
the frogs, like thousands of sinister voices, sustained
their croaking chorus, as if in ironic commentary on
the</p>

<p class="verse">To challenge from the scornful Sphinx.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent">Whenever Tōkyō crushed a hope or destroyed an
illusion, I generally sought and sometimes found balm
in Kyōto. There at least historic beauty is not marred
and violated at every turn by modern innovation. The
vulgar reality of the Shin-Yoshiwara had effectually
dissipated my preconception of it, romantically based
on book and picture. But, five months after the
Asakusa frogs had mocked at my disillusion, I was
urged by a Japanese artist to accompany him to
Shimabara, about five miles out of Kyōto on the
way to Lake Biwa, where, he said, some few vestiges
were yet to be seen of the <em>oiran’s</em> fading supremacy.
Accordingly, having telephoned from the city to the
village (impossible to avoid modernity!), which is
happily omitted from the discreet pages of Murray, we
drove out on a cold October evening to the once
fashionable Tsumi-ya, a tea-house which figures in
more than one notorious novel. As we sat shivering
on the mats of the large fan-room, dimly lit by a single
lamp, it was hard to realise what famous revels
had contributed to its renown. Yet the relics were
many and convincing. On the ceiling were painted
the eight hundred and eighty-eight fans by Tosa, each
inscribed with the autograph of a distinguished visitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
a poet or a daimyō, generally both. Hard by was the
pine-room, whose faintly pictured canopy of serpentine
boughs was the work of Kōrin. And, when the
servants entered to lay the preliminary meal, they
wore the same red aprons and red sleeve-cords as in
the days when Iyeyasu was borne in his litter to the
gardens of Shoji Jinyemon.</p>

<p>It would seem that the routine of ambrosial nights
does not greatly vary in the land of perpetual etiquette.
Having sipped rather than supped, the dishes being
light and fluid, we summoned the usual geisha, but
among them, as the artist had forewarned me, was one
of unusual distinction. O Wakatai San (her name
was equivalent to “The Honourable Young Person”)
had long been the torture and despair of susceptible
visitors. Her father was a <em>samurai</em>, strict and proud,
who had trained her in a school of arbitrary virtue.
Suitors had been one and all rejected; even Lord W.,
offering bribes of incredible amount, had gone empty
away. She was losing her youth, having reached the
age of twenty-three, but her regular features and
sunny smile helped one to forget the rather raucous
tones of her voice. She had seen enough of the
Shimabara life to pity its victims, and sang us some
rather sad ditties on the subject, of which I transcribe
two. The first refers to the prisoner’s longing for
liberty.</p>

<div class="caption">The <em>Taiyu</em> waves her <em>saké</em>-cup.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The other is a little difficult to render, since each
line has a double meaning: the point turns on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>punning elasticity of <em>mi</em>, a word signifying seed, self,
and body. The flower to which allusion is made, a
yellow rose that blooms in mountainous districts, is
always known as the wanton’s flower.</p>


<p class="pfs90 smcap">The Wanton’s Flower.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">The hill-girl’s body</p>
<p class="verse">Is sold for silver:</p>
<p class="verse">Poor, seedless hill-rose,</p>
<p class="verse5">A prison-flower!</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Whatever novelists and dramatists may have written
in glorification of the Scarlet Lady, the popular feeling,
as voiced in vulgar songs, is pure compassion.</p>

<p>It was signified that on payment of a small sum we
might now behold a resurrected <em>taiyu</em>, wearing the
robes and insignia of her order. Assent being given,
three blows were struck on a huge gong at the gate to
summon the siren, who had never been subjected to
the ignominious exposure of a cage, but came in state
to meet her suitors at the Tsumi-ya. Alas! the state
had been sadly curtailed! We saw no attendant
henchmen, no ministering children, but three rosy-cheeked
peasant-girls rather suddenly irradiated the
gloom of that historic chamber, bearing without dignity
the weight of a bygone royalty. The costumes were,
in truth, splendid enough, and the crowns of heavy
hairpins quite impressive. On the trailing robe of the
first was represented a cloud cleft by lightning above
a golden dragon; on that of the second, a rock with
peonies; on that of the third, a tiger chasing a butterfly.
All three designs were lavishly embroidered with gold.
Sweeping her cumbrous skirt aside with one hand,
the <em>taiyu</em> held in the other a wide <em>saké</em>-cup, which
she slowly waved in air, repeating an old Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
formula, which neither the artist nor the red-aproned
<em>nakauri</em> could interpret. For nearly five hundred
years the room of fans had seen the <em>taiyu</em> wave her
<em>saké</em>-cup, had heard her use those words, but we could
not evoke from its shadowy depths the ghost of an
explanation. We must take the spectacle for what it
was, the pale survival and ineffectual remnant of dying
custom. Somehow, the awkward mummery of the
girls and the bleak discomfort of the old tea-house
seemed strangely appropriate. It was as though we
were fitly rewarded for copying Dr. Faustus’ impious
trick of calling up fair phantoms from the past, not
realising that communion is impossible between living
and dead....</p>

<p>The Scarlet Lady has not yet lost her hold on new
Japan. The “unruly wills and affections of sinful
men” are too strong for that. But she has lost her
glamour. Poets do not sing of her, painters withhold
their homage, though she is represented by a barrister
in the Lower House of the Diet. For now she has
become a thing more sacrosanct than any vestal virgin&mdash;a
vested interest. She is exploited by numerous
joint-stock companies, in which shares are held by quite
important people. Their aggregate capital is enormous,
their ability to block all reform, which might tend to
reduce profits, correspondingly great. The law is at
once her protector and her gaoler. If invoked to check
cruelty, it must also enforce the observance of contracts.
All one can hope is that, so long as custom shall recognise
and government control her, at least her outlook
may not darken from red to black.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
